These reactions are facilitated through callbacks, allowing Super Apps to engage dynamically with the creation, modification, and termination of Super Agreements.\n\n## **Reacting to Super Agreements**\n\nThe reactivity of Super Apps stems from **callbacks**. These are segments of code within the Super App that are triggered when a Super Agreement involving the Super App is created, updated, or deleted. Such callbacks can execute various actions, from minting NFTs to initiating new Streams (Constant Flow Agreements).\n\n### **Example - Stream Consolidator Super App**\n\nConsider a Super App designed to consolidate all incoming flows into a single outgoing flow to a specific account (Account Z):\n\n1. **Incoming Flow from Account A**: Account A initiates a Money Stream to the Super App (100 USDCx/mo). The Super App, in turn, starts an outbound Stream of the same rate to Account Z.\n2. **Multiple Flow Adjustments**: If Account B starts a new Money Stream to the Super App (25 USDCx/mo) and Account A adjusts its flow (to 50 USDCx/mo), the Super App responds by updating its outbound Streams accordingly.\n3. **Ongoing Reactions**: The Super App continues to adapt to new Money Streams or adjustments from various accounts, maintaining a reactive outbound flow.\n\n<Admonition type=\"info\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: For a smart contract to qualify as a Super App, it must have defined callbacks to interact with Super Agreements.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Registering With The Protocol\n\nRegistration of a Super App with the Superfluid Protocol is crucial. This registration process involves coding the smart contract to be identifiable as a Super App within the protocol.\n\n### Purpose of Registration\n\n- **Protocol Recognition**: When a stream is initiated towards a contract, the Superfluid Protocol checks if the recipient is a registered Super App.\n- **Callback Activation**: If identified as a Super App, the protocol activates the Super App's callbacks, enabling its reactive capabilities.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![Super App Registration](/assets/image_(82).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Super App Registration*</p>\n</div>\n\n## Why Are Super Apps Needed?\n\nSuper Apps introduce a layer of programmability to Super Agreements, enhancing the potential for innovative decentralized applications (dApps).\n\n### Potential Use Cases\n\n- **Lending Applications**: Automate loan repayments through Streams, eliminating the need for manual transactions.\n- **Subscription Services**: Enable on-chain subscriptions paid via Streams, incorporating features like automatic affiliate payouts.\n\nSuper Apps open up a realm of possibilities, combining custom logic with the functionalities of Super Agreements to craft unique and scalable dApps.\n\nFor further inspiration, explore the following examples of Super Apps:\n\n[Explore Super App Examples](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples)\n",

Interaction with a Super Agreement is typically done by calling [`callAgreement()`](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/interacting-with-superfluid-smart-contracts) on the Host Contract, specifying the agreement and parameters.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Upgradeability and Expansion**: Super Agreements can be updated or new ones can be added and registered with the Host Contract.\n\n<Admonition type=\"info\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Direct interactions with Super Token contracts are not required for invoking Super Agreements. Instead, these agreements are accessed via the Host Contract, which then manages the Super Token balances involved.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Super Tokens 🔗 Host Contract\n\nSuper Tokens form the foundational layer of the Superfluid Protocol, where all Super Agreement data for an account is compiled.\n\n### Functionality\n\n- **Aggregated Balance Calculation**: The impact of each Super Agreement on an account's balance is cumulatively calculated to determine the Super Token balance.\n- **Data Sourcing**: Super Token contracts obtain necessary data through the Host Contract by iterating over the registered Super Agreements.\n\n## Super Apps 🔗 Host Contract\n\nRegistration of Super Apps with the Superfluid Host is essential to enable their callback functionalities.\n\n### Interaction Mechanics\n\n- **Registration Requirement**: Super Apps must be registered with the Host to function correctly.\n- **Callback Activation**: When a Super Agreement is engaged with a Super App, the Host Contract triggers the Super App's callbacks.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![Super Apps and Host Contract](/assets/image_(58).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Super Apps and Host Contract*</p>\n</div>\n\nIn summary, the Superfluid Host Contract is integral to the Superfluid Protocol, facilitating seamless interactions and integrations among Super Tokens, Super Agreements, and Super Apps.\n",

Types include ERC20 Wrapper Tokens, Pure Super Tokens, and Native Asset Super Tokens. Detailed information is available in our [Super Tokens section](../developers/super-tokens/super-tokens/).\n\n**Wrap**: The process of converting ERC20 tokens into wrapped super tokens. This involves transferring ERC20 assets into the wrapper contract and receiving an equivalent amount of super tokens.\n\n**Unwrap**: Converting wrapped super tokens back into their underlying ERC20 assets. This involves burning super tokens and transferring the underlying asset to the user.\n\n**Real Time Balance**: A dynamic calculation of an account's balance, considering both Superfluid agreement logic and static token balances.\n\n## Agreements\n\n**Superfluid Agreement**: Additional functionalities for Super Tokens provided by the Superfluid protocol.

Furthermore, they do not allow for distributing money streaming\n:::\n\n## Overview\n\nDistributions function by allowing for the creation of **pools** with a designated **pool admin** who manages **units** for **pool members**. Members of these pools can receive funds either instantly or through continuous streaming, making this method highly efficient and scalable. There are two types of Distributions:\n\n- **Instant Distributions**: They allow one transaction distribution to any number of receivers with a fixed gas cost.\n- **Streaming Distributions**: They allow for continuous distribution of funds to receivers through [Money Streaming](./money-streaming.mdx) to a Pool.\n\n---\n<Tabs defaultValue="instant" values={[\n  { label: \'Instant Distribution\', value: \'instant\' },\n  { label: \'Streaming Distribution\', value: \'streaming\' },\n]}>\n<TabItem value="instant">\n\n**Instant Distributions** allow one transaction to distribute to any number of receivers with a fixed gas cost.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  *Click on the Blue Circle to initiate an Instant Distribution*\n  <br />\n</div>\n<PoolInstantVis />\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <p>\n    *By creating a Distribution Pool, you can distribute any token instantly*\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value="streaming">\n\n**Instant Distributions** allow for continuous distribution of funds to receivers through [Money Streaming](./money-streaming.mdx) to a Pool.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  *Watch how the continuous stream gets distributed automatically through the pool*\n  <br />\n</div>\n<PoolStreamVis />\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <p>\n    *By creating a Distribution Pool, you can distribute any stream with no gas cost*\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n  </TabItem>\n  \n</Tabs>\n\n---\n\n### Definitions\n\n- **Pool**: A channel for proportional token distribution.\n- **Distribution**: The action of allocating specified token amounts to receivers.\n- **Units**: Represent the proportion of the distribution each subscriber receives.\n- **Pool Admin**: The administrator of the distribution process.\n- **Subscribers/Pool Member**: Receivers allocated units and eligible to receive tokens through the Index.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Pools as Contracts**: Unlike previous approaches, pools in streaming distributions are contracts and can be ERC20 tokens. This allows pool members to transfer units among themselves, which wasn\'t possible earlier.\n- **Roles and Permissions**: A pool admin can grant and revoke units, while any account can act as a **distributor** to execute fund distributions.\n- **Distribution Methods**: There are two primary ways to distribute funds:\n  - **Instant Distribution**: Calculated as `distributionAmount * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.\n  - **Streaming Distribution**: Determined by `poolFlowRate * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.\n- **Gas Efficiency**: The cost of executing distributions remains constant, regardless of the number of pool members.\n\n### High-Level Workflow\n\n1. **Pool Creation**: Any account can create a pool and appoint a pool admin. This pool acts as a channel for distributing funds.\n2. **Unit Management**: The pool admin assigns units to members, representing their share in future distributions.\n3. **Member Connection**: Pool members can connect to or disconnect from the pool, affecting how they access distributed funds.\n4. **Distribution Execution**: Distributors can initiate either instant or streaming distributions, which are then divided among pool members based on their unit share.\n\n## Distribution Examples\n\n### Streaming Distribution Illustration\n\nThis diagram shows a distributor streaming funds to various pool members, each holding different unit amounts. Note: A single transaction can cater to multiple members.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n![Streaming Distribution](/assets/streaming-distribution-light.png)\n</div>\n\n\n### Adjusting Unit Counts\n\nHere, a distributor modifies unit counts for members. This change instantly alters the distribution rate for all members in one transaction. Batch updates can be done using Superfluid\'s batch call.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n![Unit Count Adjustment](/assets/unit-count-adjustment.png)\n</div>\n\n### Modifying the Flow Rate\n\nThis example demonstrates how a change in the distributor\'s streaming rate affects the total flow rate of the pool, thus instantly impacting each member\'s rate.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n![Flow Rate Change](/assets/modify-flow-rate.png)\n</div>\n\n## Advanced Pool Features\n\nAs pools are also ERC20 tokens, they enable:\n\n- **Transfer of Units**: Pool members can freely transfer their units.\n- **Delegated Transfers**: Using the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions, units can be transferred on behalf of a member.\n\nThese features add composability and flexibility, expanding the potential use cases for pools in web3.\n',
      '---\nsidebar_position: 2\n---\nimport Admonition from \'@theme/Admonition\';\n\n# Money Streaming\n\n## Definition\n\nMoney Streaming is a process where tokens are continuously transferred from a sender to a receiver at a defined per-second rate. The result of this process is a "stream". A stream is perpetual and will continue until canceled by the sender/the receiver or the sender\'s Super Token balance is depleted.\n\n## **Terminology**\n\n- **Flow Rate**: The rate at which the sender\'s balance decreases and the receiver\'s increases per second.\n- **Netflow Rate**: The rate of change of an account\'s Super Token balance per second.\n- **Sender**: The account initiating the stream, specifying a receiver and flow rate.\n- **Receiver**: The account on the receiving end of a stream.\n- [**CRUD Timestamp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete): The timestamp when a stream is created, updated, or deleted.\n- **Real-Time Balance**: The change in the account\'s Super Token balance since the last CRUD action.\n- **Static Balance**: The Super Token balance at the last CRUD timestamp.\n- **Current Balance**: The sum of Static Balance and Streaming Real-Time Balance.\n\n<Admonition type="info">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Flow rates are per second but can be represented in different time units for convenience. For example, "100 USDCx/mo." is approximately "0.0039 USDCx/sec."\n</Admonition>\n\n## Computation\n\nThe netflow for an account is calculated by netting its inbound and outbound streaming flow rates.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  ![Netflow Calculation](/assets/image_(63).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <p>*Example of Net Flow calculation*</p>\n</div>\n\nWhen a stream is modified, the following are updated in the Superfluid contracts:\n\n1. New Netflow rate\n2. New CRUD timestamp\n3. New Static Balance: set to the Current Balance at the CRUD timestamp\n4. Real-Time Balance reset to zero\n\nThe Real-Time Balance then adjusts by-the-second at the netflow rate.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  ![Streaming Real-Time Balance](/assets/image_(50)_(1).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <p>*Streaming Real-Time Balance*</p>\n</div>\n\n<Admonition type="info">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Creating a stream is a one-time action. The balance is dynamically calculated and does not require continuous transactions.\n</Admonition>\n\n## **Formula**\n\n- **Static Balance**: Initial balance at the latest CRUD timestamp\n- **Real-Time Balance**: Netflow Rate * Seconds since the latest CRUD timestamp\n- **Current Balance**: Static Balance + Real-Time Balance\n\n## Example - Monitoring Account A\'s Current Balance\n\nLet\'s examine how Account A\'s balance changes with stream interactions.\n\n#### **1.

Superfluid handles this with buffer deposits and Sentinels.\n\n### Buffer\n\nBuffer deposits are taken when opening a stream, serving as a reserve in case of a critical balance. If a stream is closed before hitting critical, the buffer is refunded. In cases where the account becomes critical, the buffer is used to continue outbound streams until Sentinels intervene.\n\n### Sentinels\n\nSentinels are external actors who monitor Constant Flow Agreements (Money Streaming), close streams of critical accounts, and earn buffer deposits.\n\n_For more details, see the [Liquidations](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/solvency/liquidations-and-toga.mdx) and [Sentinels](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/solvency/running-a-sentinnel.mdx) pages._\n',

      "---\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\n# What is Superfluid?\n\n## Introduction\n\nSuperfluid is the [Money Streaming](/docs/concepts/overview/money-streaming) protocol.\nThe goal of this protocol is to build an ecosystem of apps and services that onboard people to earn every second in a consistent, sustainable way onchain.\nThis is made possible by the protocol’s smart contract framework which introduces\nthe [Super Token](/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens) - an extension to the ERC-20 standard enabling continuous and highly scalable onchain cash flows.\n\n## Super Tokens\n\nThe Superfluid protocol is designed to be a \"token-centric\" protocol, in that all of its functionalities revolve around the concept of [Super Tokens](./overview/super-tokens.mdx).\nThe framework & Super Token standard can be used to add dynamic balances to tokens on chain,\ndescribing cash flows and executing them automatically over time in a non-interactive way.\nAny token can be transferred in Superfluid streams or distributions, which are programmable, composable, and modular.\nNo capital is locked up, and all inflows and outflows are netted in real-time at every block without consuming any gas.\nThe code is fully open source, while the protocol is non-custodial and permissionless.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/Superfluid-main-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of the Superfluid Protocol*</p>\n</div>\n\n**The Superfluid Protocol has currently two main pillars that define its interactions with Super Tokens. These pillars (formerly called Agreements) are the following:**\n- [***Money Streaming***](./overview/money-streaming.mdx) - A set of features that enable the creation of money streams between two parties.\n- [***Distributions***](./overview/distributions.mdx) - A set of features that enables the creation of a pool of funds that can be distributed to multiple recipients.\n\nWe go in further details about these two pillars in the next sections.\n\n## Money Streaming\n\n### Definition\n\nMoney Streaming is a continuous transfer of tokens from a sender to a receiver at a defined per-second rate, resulting in a \"stream\". This stream is perpetual and persists until it's canceled by either the sender or the receiver, or until the sender's Super Token balance is depleted.\n\n### Explanation\n\nMoney Streaming is a novel approach to token transfers, offering a dynamic way of sending funds. Instead of one-time transactions, tokens flow from the sender to the receiver continuously, creating a stream. This method provides real-time financial transactions, enabling a more fluid movement of assets over time, reflecting real-world economic activities more closely.\n\n### Example\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/Superfluid-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of money streaming from the [Superfluid dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/)*</p>\n</div>\n\nConsider Alice wants to pay Bob a salary of 1200 USDCx per year using Money Streaming. She sets up a stream with a flow rate of 0.038 USDCx per second. Bob's balance starts increasing every second, and Alice's decreases, ensuring a steady transfer of salary.\n\n## Distributions\n\n### Definition\n\nDistributions in Superfluid refer to a scalable one-to-many fund transfer method. It involves creating pools with a pool admin managing units for members, who can receive funds instantly or through continuous streaming.\n\n### Explanation\n\nDistributions are a significant advancement in decentralized finance, enabling efficient and scalable fund transfers among multiple recipients. This method is especially useful for scenarios where funds need to be distributed among many parties, like dividends or rewards, ensuring equitable and automated distribution based on predefined units.\n\n### Example\n\nImagine a DeFi project creating a reward pool for liquidity providers. The project sets up a distribution pool with a total of 1000 units. If a liquidity provider has 100 units, they receive 10% of the total funds distributed through the pool, either instantly or as a continuous stream, depending on the distribution method.\n\n",

By using Superfluid's streaming technology,\nit allows for continuous and automated investment flows, reducing the need for manual intervention and making investment more seamless and user-friendly.\n- **Reduced Volatility Impact:** The core idea of TCA is to mitigate the risks associated with volatile market conditions.\nSuperfluid enhances this approach by allowing for more frequent and smaller investments, thereby further reducing the potential impact of sudden market changes.\n- **Innovation in DeFi:** By leveraging Superfluid's groundbreaking streaming technology, this TCA app stands at the forefront of innovation in decentralized finance, offering a unique approach to cryptocurrency investments.",

When your Super Token balance reaches a certain lower threshold, Auto-Wrap steps in and wraps enough tokens into the needed Super Token on your behalf to ensure you never run out of balance, as that would make all streams stop.\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://www.notion.so/superfluidhq/Setting-Up-Superfluid-Auto-Wrap-9a565d53bbee4bdc953cc2a656c43761\"\n      className=\"button-link\"\n      style={{\n         backgroundColor: 'green',\n         color: 'white',\n         fontSize: '16px',\n         padding: '10px 20px',\n         textDecoration: 'none',\n         borderRadius: '4px',\n         display: 'inline-block'\n      }}\n   >\n      Click here for full a guide on how to set up an Auto-Wrap Automation\n   </a>\n</div>\n\n## Why Auto-Wrap?\n\nMost organizations don’t hold their assets as Super Tokens. DAOs are more likely to hold USDC than USDCx in their treasury to limit exposure to third party protocols. So when a DAO is paying contributors in streams of USDCx they need to ensure they periodically wrap additional USDC in USDCx to keep their streams running. This can be a tedious manual process because it requires you to:\n\n1. Periodically check the Super Token balance to make sure it isn’t reaching zero.\n2. If it is approaching zero, manually wrap additional USDC to USDCx to avoid running out of USDCx balance.\n\nWith Auto-Wrap, this manual process is fully automated. The system keeps monitoring a wallet balance of a specific token (i.e. USDC) and when it’s too low (normally less than 2 days worth of outgoing streaming) it automatically wraps a variable amount (normally 7 days worth of outgoing streaming) to keep streams running over time. All payroll admin needs to do is ensure they’re holding enough USDC in their wallet - the wrapping part is taken care of by Auto-Wrap.\n\n## Example\n\n1. Auto-Wrap identifies that the DAO’s DAIx balance is running low. In this example, it’s less than a two days away from running out of DAIx.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n![Auto-Wrap identifying low balance](/assets/image_(5)_(3)_(1).png)\n</div>\n\n2. Auto-Wrap automatically steps in and replenishes the DAIx balance back to seven days worth of outgoing stream so payment continues without interruption. No manual triggering required!\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n![Auto-Wrap replenishing balance](/assets/image_(8).png)\n</div>\n\n## Setting Up Auto-Wrap\n\nTo set up Auto-Wrap for your organization, follow the detailed guide available here:\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://www.notion.so/superfluidhq/Setting-Up-Superfluid-Auto-Wrap-9a565d53bbee4bdc953cc2a656c43761\"\n      className=\"button-link\"\n      style={{\n         backgroundColor: 'green',\n         color: 'white',\n         fontSize: '16px',\n         padding: '10px 20px',\n         textDecoration: 'none',\n         borderRadius: '4px',\n         display: 'inline-block'\n      }}\n   >\n      Click here for full a guide on how to set up an Auto-Wrap Automation\n   </a>\n</div>\n",

It's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient. The contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream, ensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.\n\nWhile the integration of the Vesting Scheduler into the Superfluid Dashboard is forthcoming, it's already possible to interact directly with the contract alongside off-chain automations.

With this system, you can:\n\n- Implement linear vesting schedules with customizable cliffs.\n- Specify both the cliff date/time and amount.\n- Determine your total vesting amount and its time frame.\n- Retain all tokens in your wallet or Safe until they're transferred to the recipient.\n\n## Example:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: On January 1st, you aim to vest 400 AMZNx to Alice from February 1st to June 1st. The vesting schedule includes a cliff of 100 AMZNx on March 1st.\n\n   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n   ![Initial Vesting Setup](/assets/image_(4)_(3).png)\n   </div>\n\n2. **Cliff Execution**: On March 1st, the cliff amount of 100 AMZNx is transferred to Alice, and the linear vesting stream begins.

By leaving their streams open for too long, stream creators stand to lose this `buffer`. This mechanism creates the main incentive for users to close their Superfluid streams before running out of tokens. It is a user's own responsibility to close their stream.\n\n`superApps` can also draw an `owedDeposit`, allowing them to open a stream of the same size, without needing an initial balance.\n\nHere's the general flow of solvency states for Super Tokens in a Constant Flow Agreement (Money Streaming):\n\n#### 1. Solvent\n\nEveryone is in good standing. The sender's balance is greater than 0. The stream flows to the receiver as expected, and there are enough tokens to back the stream.\n\n#### 2. Critical\n\nThe sender's balance is now zero, and the permissions on the stream now allow anyone to close it. Until the stream is actually closed, funds are paid to the receiver's wallet using the sender's initial `buffer`.\n\nThe critical period is subdivided into 2 sub-periods:\\\na) _**Patrician Period**_: starts when the stream becomes critical (duration defined as governance parameter)\\\nb) _**Plebs Period**_: spans the remaining timeframe until the stream becomes insolvent\n\nWhen the stream is closed, any remaining `buffer` is taken and assigned/distributed either to the _**PIC**_ or a _**Pleb**_.\\\nIf the stream is closed during the Plebs Period, we call the account closing the stream a Pleb.\n\n#### 3. Insolvent\n\nIf the stream isn't closed, and the sender's deposit is completely consumed, then the insolvent period begins. The stream will continue to the receiver, however since these tokens don't actually exist in the sender's wallet, we must keep track of this `deficit` so that the Super Token itself can remain solvent within the Superfluid Protocol.\\\nWe also call this open ended timeframe the _**Pirate Period**_.\n\nWhen the stream is eventually closed, the `deficit` is taken from the PICs stake as a slashing fee. This slashing fee is then burned, to offset the tokens created by the insolvent stream. Additionally, a reward equal in amount to the `buffer` amount before its consumption is issued to the account closing the stream, whom we call a _**Pirate.**_. This reward is also detracted from the PICs stake.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n  ![Buffer and\n  balance](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/X7ShIBo-weuUDIVwxj4Klj0VNy0PNP7ajC9zNC9WxiCOMkPDfhjpK4YpNJQ8i1Oor2OjDYzxr1493JxtCU4ycHwU7lZ9rRkiwm4mRQEA9xTDybxd4WXht3JW95U6qEqEvSHA60zi)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n  <p>\n    *Visualization showing the tota user balance as well as the outgoing stream\n    part of the buffer*\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n### Patricians, Plebs and Pirates (3Ps)\n\nEach token has an account called a _**PIC (Patrician in Charge)**_.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Critical during the Patrician Period, the remaining amount of the `buffer` balance of the closed stream is taken and added to the PICs stake as a reward.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Critical during the Plebs Period, the remaining buffer is rewarded to the Pleb.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Insolvent, the PIC is slashed, and the Pirate is rewarded with the full buffer amount.\n\nThe monopoly on rewards during the Patrician Period gives PICs an incentive to make sure streams are closed during that timeframe.\\\nThey can set up one or multiple redundant instances of the [superfluid-sentinel](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-sentinel) (and/or other mechanisms for closing streams) to ensure this. Note that the PIC account is not needed (not in a _hot wallet_) for this operations as the rewards incurred during the patrician period will be added to the PIC stake regardless of transaction sender.\n\nPlebs act as a fallback in case PICs fail to do their job despite of the incentives.\\\nThe earlier in the Pleb Period a Pleb closes the stream, the more buffer there's left as a reward.\n\nUnlike the PIC, individual Plebs and Pirates don't have a monopoly. Whoever manages to get a stream closing transaction included first during the Plebs / Pirate Period, gets the reward.\n\nPatrician, Pleb and Pirate are roles which map to accounts in specific circumstances.\\\nThe same account could have any of those roles in the context of various stream closing transactions, defined by the timing of that transaction and the state of the TOGA contract (list of PICs) at the time of transaction execution. The reference sentinel implementation provides configuration options influencing that behaviour and timing of transactions.\n\nNote that thanks to this flexible roles model, PICs have an incentive to close streams even after missing the Patrician Period:\n\n1. they can still get rewards, essentially acting as a Pleb or Pirate in the context of that transaction\n2. due to the slashing of the `deficit` from their stake, their incentive to close insolvent streams grows linearly over time\n\n![Toga payoff table](</assets/image_(72).png>)\n\n### TOGA - Transparent OnGoing Auction\n\nSince the role of a PIC comes with a monopoly on rewards incurred during the Patrician Period, a fair mechanism for assigning this role is needed. Such a mechanism is provided by the TOGA.\n\nTo become a PIC for a token, aspiring Patricians must post a `stake` to the TOGA contract, in the token they are trying to become a PIC for. If the new `stake` is higher than the existing `stake`, the new Patrician becomes the PIC, and the previous Patrician gets their current `stake` back.\n\nPICs can't remove their `stake` at will through a single transaction, but rather, they have to specify an `exitRate`, which defines the flowrate of a Stream to their account. The `exitRate` is also not completely arbitrary, it is limited such that the `stake` will remain above zero for at least a week.\n\nAll liquidation rewards are added to the `stake`, thus - depending on the exitRate set by the PIC and the number of size of streams becoming critical - the stake of a PIC could shrink, grow or stay the same over time. (The maximum allowed `exitRate` is calculated based on the worst case of no rewards being added during that timeframe.)\n\nIn order to become the PIC, you can either use the Dapp at https://toga.superfluid.finance/ or use `ERC777.send()` to post the desired stake to the TOGA contract - optionally with an `exitRate` set in the `data` parameter if you don't like the default `exitRate`. The TOGA contract implements an ERC777 callback for the auction mechanism.\n\n:::warning CAUTION\nDo NOT use `ERC20.transfer()` for TOGA bids, because those may not trigger the needed callback in the future.\n:::\n\n### Current Parameters\n\n<Tabs\n    defaultValue=\"polygon\"\n    values={[\n        { label: 'Polygon', value: 'polygon' },\n        { label: 'Ethereum Mainnet', value: 'ethereum-mainnet' },\n        { label: 'Gnosis Chain', value: 'gnosis-chain' },\n        { label: 'Optimism', value: 'optimism' },\n        { label: 'Arbitrum', value: 'arbitrum' },\n        { label: 'Goerli', value: 'goerli' },\n    ]}\n>\n    <TabItem value=\"polygon\">\n        **Deposit**\n\n        4 hour `deposit`\n\n        4 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        30 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"ethereum-mainnet\">\n        **Minimum Deposit**\n\n        Ethereum L1 is a different environment from other networks where Superfluid has been deployed.\n        This is due to the fact that performing any operation on L1 is much more expensive\n        in terms of gas cost than it is on other networks.\n\n        To cover additional costs incurred by sentinels, tokens on L1 have been deployed with minimum deposit values.\n        This means that the buffer on each of these tokens will not always be calculated\n        as 4 hours worth of the stream as it is on lower cost networks.\n\n        - ETHx: 0.042 ETHx\n        - USDCx & DAIx: 69 tokens\n\n        **Deposit**\n\n        4 hour `deposit` (note that this value only applies if the deposit is > the min deposit)\n\n        4 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        30 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"gnosis-chain\">\n        **Deposit**\n\n        4 hour `deposit`\n\n        4 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        30 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"optimism\">\n        **Deposit**\n\n        4 hour `deposit`\n\n        4 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        30 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"arbitrum\">\n        **Deposit**\n\n        4 hour `deposit`\n\n        4 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        30 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n    <TabItem value=\"goerli\">\n        **Deposit**\n\n        1 hour `deposit`\n\n        1 hour maximum `owedDeposit`\n\n        12 minutes `patrician period`\n\n        **TOGA**\n\n        1 week minimum `exitPeriod`\n\n        4 week default `exitPeriod`\n    </TabItem>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n---\n\n:::info\nNote that this parameter definitions in terms of time units refer to simplified idealized scenarios and are basically lower bounds.\n:::\n\n\\\nThe deposit related timeframes directly apply for streams where the sender account has no incoming streams and where the net flowrate is thus equal to the outgoing flowrate. If however the sender account has incoming streams, this timeframes are stretched proportionally. If for example the aggregate incoming flowrate is half of the aggregate outgoing flowrate, the time for the buffer to be consumed (critial period) doubles, as do the patrician period and the plebs period. If the aggregate incoming flowrate equals the aggregate outgoing flowrate (net flowrate = zero), those periods become potentially infinite (as long as the net flowrate doesn't change), because in that case the buffer wouldn't be consumed further, but not restored either, leaving outgoing streams critical in perpetuity.\n\n\\\nFor the TOGA `exitPeriod`, something similar applies - it's the lower bound for how long it would take a PIC to stream out the stake with a given `exitRate`, assuming nothing is added to the stake during that time. In practice, accrued liquidation rewards may be added to the stake during that time, leading to a proportional extension of the exitPeriod. In theory such added rewards could even completely offset the exitRate, leading to a net growing stake. In that case the PIC could periodically increase the exitRate (a larger stake allows for a larger exitRate) and would eventually be able to set an exitRate which leads to a shrinking stake.\n",

      '---\nsidebar_position: 3\n---\n\n\n# Callbacks\n\nSuper App callbacks play a pivotal role in how Super Apps interact with the Superfluid Protocol. These callbacks are invoked in response to specific events related to Super Agreements.\n\n## Callback Invocation Conditions\n\nDepending on the Super Agreement involved, the callbacks are triggered under different scenarios. The following table outlines these conditions:\n\n<table><thead><tr><th width="150">Agreement</th><th width="273.3632148377125">Callback</th><th>Condition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CFAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementCreated, afterAgreementCreated</td><td>A stream to a Super App is created.</td></tr><tr><td>CFAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementUpdated, afterAgreementUpdated</td><td>A stream to a Super App is updated.</td></tr><tr><td>CFAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementTerminated, afterAgreementTerminated</td><td>A stream to a Super App is deleted.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementCreated, afterAgreementCreated</td><td>A subscription (with zero units) to an index published by a Super App is approved.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementUpdated, afterAgreementUpdated</td><td>A subscription (with units) to an index published by a Super App is approved.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementTerminated, afterAgreementTerminated</td><td>A subscription to an index published by a Super App is revoked.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementUpdated, afterAgreementUpdated</td><td>A subscription to an index published by a Super App is claimed</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementCreated, afterAgreementCreated</td><td>Units of an index are issued to a Super App if the units were previously zero.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementUpdated, afterAgreementUpdated</td><td>Units of an index are issued to a Super App if the units were previously non-zero.</td></tr><tr><td>IDAv1</td><td>beforeAgreementTerminated, afterAgreementTerminated</td><td>Units of an index issued to a Super App are deleted.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n## Callback Origin\n\nThe Superfluid protocol itself triggers these callbacks on-chain in response to various actions performed within the Constant Flow Agreement contract. The protocol checks if a Super App is involved in a transaction and, if so, executes the relevant callbacks.\n\n### Anatomy of Super App Callbacks\n\nBelow are examples of Super App callbacks and their structure:\n\n```solidity\nfunction beforeAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n) external view virtual override returns (bytes memory /*cbdata*/) {\n    revert("Unsupported callback - Before Agreement Created");\n}\n```\n\n```solidity\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*cbdata*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n) external virtual override returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {\n    revert("Unsupported callback - After Agreement Created");\n}\n```\n\n#### Callback Execution\n\n* `beforeAgreement` callbacks are executed before the corresponding agreement contract action. They are `view` functions and can return data to be used in `afterAgreement` callbacks.\n* `afterAgreement` callbacks are executed after the agreement contract action. They can implement logic based on the outcome of the agreement action and the data returned from `beforeAgreement` callbacks.\n\n#### Callback Parameters\n\n* **`ISuperToken`**: The Super Token used in the transaction.\n* **`address`**: Address of the Constant Flow Agreement contract.\n* **`agreementId`**: A unique identifier for the agreement.\n* **`agreementData`**: Encoded data of the agreement details.\n* **`cbdata`**: Data returned from `beforeAgreement` callbacks (applicable to `afterAgreement` callbacks).\n* **`ctx`**: Context of the transaction, essential for understanding the background of the callback invocation.\n\n### Utilizing Callbacks\n\nUnderstanding and effectively using these callbacks is crucial for Super App developers. Each callback serves a specific purpose and offers the flexibility to execute custom logic in response to changes in Super Agreements.\n\n## CallAgreement vs CallAgreementWithContext\n\nIf you\'re making a call to a Superfluid agreement inside of a Super App callback, you should remember that you need to "receive a context, and return a context" by using the `callAgreementWithContext` function. If you\'re not making this call inside of a Super App callback, you should use `callAgreement`.\n\n\n:::note\nNote that this is a highly technical section for those looking to understand lower level features of the protocol. If you\'re looking to create, update, and delete streams or work with the instant distribution agreement in your super app callbacks, you can refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/blob/main/projects/tradeable-cashflow/contracts/RedirectAll.sol#L223) to perform these operations in a single line of code.\n:::\n\n### In Depth\n\nWhen calling the host contract to trigger actions related to the constant flow agreement (CFA) or instant distribution agreement (IDA), you may use either `callAgreement` or `callAgreementWithContext`. Both of these functions allow you to pass in an encoded call to the agreement you\'d like to interact with, as well as an optional `userData` value. The `callAgreementWithContext` function will perform the same actions as the `callAgreement` function, but it also enables you to pass in a new context value (abbreviated `ctx` ) to your function call.\n\nKeep in mind that `callAgreementWithContext` is designed for use within Super Apps - if this function is run outside of a Super App, then `callAgreementWithContext` will fail due to this statement:\n\n``` solidity\nrequire(\n    context.appAddress == msg.sender,  \n    "SF: callAgreementWithContext from wrong address"\n);\n```\n\n`callAgreementWithContext` is primarily meant for use within Super App callbacks. Each Super App callback will be passed a context value (`ctx`) from the host contract (as the Superfluid host contract is the _caller_ of each callback). This `ctx` value is what needs to be passed to any call you want to make to the Superfluid host contract _inside_ of your callback (this goes for all operations which create, update, and delete flows in these callbacks). As a reminder, the logic within the \'host\' contract can be found in `Superfluid.sol`.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//a function which we\'ll use to create a flow within a callback\nfunction _createFlowInCallback(\n        bytes calldata ctx,\n        ISuperfluid _host, \n        IConstantFlowAgreementV1 _cfa,    \n        ISuperfluidToken _acceptedToken,\n        address _receiver, \n        int96 _flowRate\t\n    )\n\tprivate\n\treturns (bytes memory newCtx)\n    {\n        newCtx = ctx;\n\n        (newCtx,) = _host.callAgreementwithContext(\n\t    _cfa,\n            abi.encodeWithSelector(\n            _cfa.deleteFlow.selector,\n            _acceptedToken,\n            address(this),\n\t    _receiver,\n            new bytes(0) // placeholder\n          ),\n          "0x", //placeholder userdata value\n          newCtx //passing in the context from the super app callback\n       );\t\n}\n\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n//passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n   return _createFlowInCallback(_ctx, _host, _cfa, _acceptedToken, _receiver, _flowrate); \n}\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\n\nYou can also do this in a much easier way by using our new CFA Library, which abstracts away the need to use `host.callAgreement` or `host.callAgreementWithContext` directly.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\nusing CFALibraryV1 for CFALibraryV1.InitData;\n\n    //initialize cfaV1 variable\n    CFALibraryV1.InitData public cfaV1; \n\n    constructor(\n        ISuperfluid host\n    ) {\n\n    //initialize InitData struct, and set equal to cfaV1\n    cfaV1 = CFALibraryV1.InitData(\n       host,\n       IConstantFlowAgreementV1(\n\t  address(host.getAgreementClass(\n           keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n\t   ))\n        )\n     );\n   }\n\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n//passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n//createFlowWithCtx makes use of callAgreementWithContext\n   return cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(_ctx, receiver, token, flowRate);\n}\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nYou may have another scenario in which you want to make additional calls to the host contract after you first run `callAgreementWithContext`. If you do this, you can save the value returned by the first `callAgreementWithContext` function to a new variable, then pass this value to your next call to `callAgreementWithContext` . The takeaway here is that you need to pass the most recent iteration of `ctx` when creating, updating, or deleting flows inside Super App callbacks. You can see this done here with the CFA Library:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\nusing CFALibraryV1 for CFALibraryV1.InitData;\n\n    //initialize cfaV1 variable\n    CFALibraryV1.InitData public cfaV1; \n\n    constructor(\n        ISuperfluid host\n    ) {\n\n    //initialize InitData struct, and set equal to cfaV1\n    cfaV1 = CFALibraryV1.InitData(\n       host,\n       IConstantFlowAgreementV1(\n\t  address(host.getAgreementClass(\n           keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n\t    ))\n        )\n     );\n   }\n\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n   newCtx = cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(_ctx, receiver, token, flowRate); //passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n   newCtx = cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(newCtx, receiver, token, flowRate); //passing in the ctx which is returned from the first call here\n\t\t\t \n}\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nOne final item to note is to not manually change the value of `ctx` when it\'s used within a Super App. `Ctx` is formatted in a very specific way within a struct that is compiled to bytecode by the protocol, and it\'s not meant to be manipulated directly. If you wish to pass in userData to your function call, this can be done by simply adding the `userData` value in as a parameter:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\n//using the CFA Library:\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n   //passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n   //createFlowWithCtx makes use of callAgreementWithContext\n   return cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(_ctx, receiver, token, flowRate, userData);\n}\n\n//using a low level call\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n  {\n\tnewCtx = _ctx;\n\t (newCtx,) = _host.callAgreementwithContext(\n\t      _cfa,\n\t      abi.encodeWithSelector(\n\t      _cfa.deleteFlow.selector,\n\t      _acceptedToken,\n\t      address(this),\n\t      _receiver,\n        new bytes(0) // placeholder\n      ),\n      userData, //userData goes here\n      newCtx //passing in the context from the super app callback\n   );\t\n }\n\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nIf you read through the Superfluid codebase, you\'ll see that nearly every state changing operation will return a context value. This `ctx` value helps to provide additional internal accounting for the protocol to enhance security, and it allows you to decode it and make use of values like userData inside Super Apps. When making calls within your Super Apps, keep in mind that you need to pass in updated context values if you want to make use of the callbacks properly. Remember: if you need to run callAgreement within a Super App callback, you\'ll need to use `callAgreementWithContext` and pass in `ctx`.\n',

      '---\nsidebar_position: 4\n---\n# Registering Super Apps\n\n## Overview\n\nTo activate a Super App, you need to register it in the [Superfluid Host](/docs/concepts/advanced-topics/superfluid-host) contract. This registration is crucial for enabling the Super App\'s business logic to be invoked via agreement hooks.\n\n## Registration Process\n\n### Basic Registration\n\nYou can \n\n1. Use the `registerApp` method of the host contract.\n2. Two ways to register:\n   - Self-registration: `registerApp(configWord)`\n   - Registration by another account: `registerApp(app, configWord)`\n\n\n\n### Permissioned vs. Non-Permissioned Networks\n\nSome networks require additional steps for Super App registration. Here\'s how to check:\n\n1. Query `host.APP_WHITE_LISTING_ENABLED()` on your target network.\n2. You can do this via the Superfluid Explorer:\n   - Go to the "protocol" section (e.g., [Polygon Mainnet Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/matic/protocol))\n   - Click the Explorer link for "Host"\n   - Navigate to Contract -> Read as Proxy\n   - Expand "WHITE_LISTING_ENABLED"\n\n![Superfluid Explorer Screenshot](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/assets/5479136/442b460c-d1e9-419e-8483-12235ca19f0a)\n\n- If `false`: Standard registration process applies\n- If `true`: Follow the permissioned registration process below\n\n## Permissioned App Registration\n\nIf your target network requires permissioned registration:\n\n1. Get a "deployer" account whitelisted (can be an EOA or a contract)\n2. Choose your deployment strategy:\n\n   a) For a single Super App:\n   - Register in the constructor or initialize method\n   - Use `host.registerApp(configWord)`\n   - Whitelist the EOA making this transaction\n\n   b) For multiple Super App instances (e.g., factory pattern):\n   - Whitelist a contract as the deployer\n   - Use `host.registerApp(app, configWord)` from this contract\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Using `registerApp(configWord)`: `tx.origin` must be whitelisted\n- Using `registerApp(app, configWord)`: `msg.sender` must be whitelisted\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you need assistance or have questions about the process:\n1. Join our [Discord](http://discord.superfluid.finance/)\n2. Contact the Superfluid dev team in the #development channel\n\n## Code Examples\n\nHere are some basic examples to illustrate the registration process:\n\n```solidity\n// Self-registration in constructor\nconstructor(ISuperfluid host, uint256 configWord) {\n    host.registerApp(configWord);\n}\n\n// Registration by another account\nfunction registerSuperApp(ISuperfluid host, ISuperApp app, uint256 configWord) external {\n    host.registerApp(app, configWord);\n}\n```\n\nRemember to adjust these examples based on your specific Super App implementation and network requirements.',
      "---\nsidebar_position: 2\n---\n\nimport Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';\nimport CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';\n\n# Super Apps in Depth\n\n### **What is a Super App?**\n\nSuper Apps are smart contracts registered with the Superfluid Protocol, allowing them to **react to Super Agreements** (like money streams). They are similar to ERC777 hooks but for Super Agreements.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![The Tradeable Cashflow NFT](/assets/image_(29)_(1).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*The Tradeable Cashflow NFT*</p>\n</div>\n\nSuper Apps can execute custom logic in response to streaming-related actions. A great example is the [tradeable cashflow NFT contract](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/c784d239557d6fb5e56a2c8951ac4353256d611d/projects/tradeable-cashflow), which automatically opens a new stream from the NFT contract to the owner of the NFT upon receiving a stream.\n\nCallbacks in Super Apps are triggered by these actions:\n\n1. A flow is opened with the Super App as the `receiver`.\n2. A flow involving the Super App as the `receiver` is updated.\n3. A flow is closed by the Super App's counterparty.\n\nThese callbacks can execute any arbitrary logic, enabling a wide range of possibilities for Super Apps.\n\n### Super App Configuration\n\nSuper Apps need to be registered with the Superfluid Protocol to use callbacks. Here's how to register a Super App:\n\n<CodeBlock className=\"language-javascript\">\n{`\n// Example registration code for a Super App\nuint256 configWord =\n    SuperAppDefinitions.APP_LEVEL_FINAL |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_CREATED_NOOP |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_UPDATED_NOOP |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_TERMINATED_NOOP;\n\nstring memory registrationKey = \"\"; // Can be empty for testnet deployments\n\n_host.registerAppWithKey(configWord, registrationKey);\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\nThe `APP_LEVEL_FINAL` flag ensures that the callbacks run in the first app in a chain of Super Apps. The `_NOOP` designations specify which callbacks are not used, avoiding unnecessary reverts.\n\nFor mainnet deployments, pre-approval is required for registering Super Apps. Check out the [Super App White-listing Guide](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/Super-App-White-listing-Guide) for more information.\n\n### Super App Stream Buffers\n\nWhen creating a Superfluid stream, an up-front buffer is taken to ensure the protocol's security. These deposits vary based on whether the stream is sent to a Super App and whether it's on testnet or mainnet.\n\nFor example, on testnets, the deposit is 1 hour x `flowRate` for non-Super Apps and up to 2 hours x `flowRate` for Super Apps. On mainnet, these values are 4 hours and 8 hours x `flowRate`, respectively.\n\n### Super App Callbacks\n\nSuper App callbacks are triggered in response to certain actions in Superfluid agreements:\n\n- When a stream is created, updated, or closed involving a Super App.\n- Before and after these actions occur, different callbacks are executed.\n\nCallback Anatomy:\n\n<CodeBlock className=\"language-javascript\">\n{`\nfunction beforeAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n)\n    external\n    view\n    virtual\n    override\n    returns (bytes memory /*cbdata*/)\n{\n    revert(\"Unsupported callback - Before Agreement Created\");\n}\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\n<CodeBlock className=\"language-javascript\">\n{`\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*cbdata*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n)\n    external\n    virtual\n    override\n    returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/)\n{\n    revert(\"Unsupported callback - After Agreement Created\");\n}\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\n### Super App Rules (Jail System)\n\nSuper Apps must comply with specific rules to avoid being jailed. These rules ensure the security and proper functioning of the protocol.\n\n1. Super Apps cannot revert in the termination callback.\n2. Super Apps must not become insolvent.\n3. Operations within the termination callback must adhere to a gas limit.\n4. The `ctx` data must be correctly handled in the termination callback.\n\n#### Checking for Jailing\n\nTo check if a Super App is jailed, call `isAppJailed` on the Superfluid Host contract with the Super App's address. This can be done on Etherscan or through the Superfluid subgraph.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n  For more details on the Jail system and Super App rules, visit the [Superfluid documentation](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid).\n</Admonition>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSuper Apps offer a versatile framework for building complex, reactive financial applications on the Superfluid Protocol. By understanding their mechanics, rules, and potential, developers can create innovative solutions for real-time finance.",

They are designed to be flexible, allowing for both instant and streaming distributions.\n\n- **Instant Distributions**: Allow for a one-time distribution of a specified amount of tokens to all members of a pool instantly.\n- **Streaming Distributions**: Enable a continuous flow of tokens to pool members over time.\n\n:::note About Pools\nThe same pool can be used to distribute any Super Token, be it for Instant or Streaming Distributions.\n:::\n\n\n## Key Functions of SuperTokenV1Library.sol\n\n[`SuperTokenV1Library.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) provides several functions to interact with pools and distributions:\n\n\n### createPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(ISuperToken token, address admin, struct PoolConfig poolConfig) internal returns (contract ISuperfluidPool pool)\n\n// simplified variant using the following default settings:\n// admin = msg.sender, poolConfig = { transferabilityForUnitsOwner: false, distributionFromAnyAddress: true }\nfunction createPool(contract ISuperToken token) internal returns (contract ISuperfluidPool pool);\n```\n\nCreates a new Superfluid Distribution Pool.\n\n### distribute\n\n```solidity\nfunction distribute(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nDistributes the specified amount of tokens among pool members.\n\n### distributeFlow\n\n```solidity\nfunction distributeFlow(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, int96 requestedFlowRate) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nInitiates a distribution flow from a sender to a pool with the specified total flow rate.\n\n:::warning Important\nKeep in mind that the total amount of units in the pool needs to be significantly lower than the total flow rate or the total tokens distributed of the pool.\nTo understand more why this is the case, please refer to the [Member Units](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx#about-member-units) section.\n:::\n\n### connectPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction connectPool(ISuperToken token, contract ISuperfluidPool pool) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nConnects a pool member to pool.\n\n:::tip About Pool Connections\nLearn more about claiming units and connecting to pools in the [How to design your pools section](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools#about-pool-connections-and-claiming).\n:::\n\n### getFlowDistributionFlowRate\n\n```solidity\nfunction getFlowDistributionFlowRate(ISuperToken token, address from, ISuperfluidPool to) internal view returns (int96)\n```\n\nGets the flow rate of a distribution from a sender to a pool.\n\n### isMemberConnected\n\n```solidity\nfunction isMemberConnected(ISuperToken token, address pool, address member) internal view returns (bool)\n```\n\nChecks whether a member is connected to a pool and eligible to receive distributions.\n\n## ISuperfluidPool\n\n### updateMemberUnits\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateMemberUnits(address memberAddress, uint128 newUnits) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nUpdates the units of a pool member.\n\n## Contract Example\n\nHere's a simple contract example using some of the functions from `SuperTokenV1Library.sol` to interact with distributions:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/superfluid/SuperTokenV1Library.sol\";\n\ncontract MyDistributionsContract {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    ISuperToken private _superToken;\n\n    constructor(ISuperToken superToken) {\n        _superToken = superToken;\n    }\n\n    function estimateDistribution(ISuperfluidPool pool, uint256 amount) public {\n        _superToken.estimateDistributionActualAmount(address(this), pool, amount);\n        // Additional logic for distribution\n    }\n\n    function startStreamingDistribution(ISuperfluidPool pool, int96 flowRate) public {\n        _superToken.distributeFlow(pool, flowRate);\n        // Additional logic for streaming distribution\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract demonstrates how to use the `SuperTokenV1Library` in order to interact with Distribution Pools.\n\n:::tip\nWhen using the `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`, you don't need to include the `SuperToken` as a parameter in your method call.\nSimply call `SuperToken.[Method]` and the library will handle the rest.\n:::\n\n## Further Reading\nFor more detailed information on the implementation and usage of `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`, refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library Technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n",

Members hold units within the pool that determine their proportion of the distribution.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n<PoolsVisualization/>\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of units in a pool*</p>\n</div>\n\n:::note\n\nThe Superfluid pool implements basic ERC20 functionality, allowing it to interact seamlessly with [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) standards.\nThis allows you to interact with the pool units as if they were ERC20 tokens, including transferring them to other addresses, if it is allowed by the pool configuration.\nCheck the [next section](#important-functions) for more information on pool configurations.\n\n:::\n\n## About Member Units\n\n### How is a member's share of the pool determined?\n\nA pool member's units determine their share of the pool's distributions.\nIn the background, the calculation of each member's share is calculated following these two steps:\n\n1. **Calculating the flow rate per unit:** We calculate the flow rate or amount of tokens to be distributed *per unit* like so:\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/flowrate-formula.png\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"400\" />\n</div>\n<br/>\n2. **Calculating the flow rate for each member:** We multiply the flow rate per unit by the number of units each member has to get the flow rate for each member, as follows:\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/flowrate-member-units.png\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"500\" />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\nOne of the limitations of Solidity is its incapacity to handle floating point numbers. \nThis makes it so that the flow rate per unit is calculated as an integer. If the result of the division is not an integer, the result is rounded down.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples below show how the flow rate per unit is calculated in different scenarios where Distributions reach their limitations\n\n1. **Example 1:** Let's take a pool that has 100 wei/second as total flow rate and 3 members, each member has 1 unit.\n    - The flow rate per unit is 100 / 3 = 33.33\n    - However, since Solidity can't handle floating point numbers, the flow rate per unit is 33\n    - The pool distributes 33 tokens to each unit\n    - 1 token is left undistributed\n2. **Example 2:** Let's take a pool that has 100 wei/second as total flow rate and 200 members, each member has 1 units.\n    - The flow rate per unit is 100 / 200 = 0.5\n    - However, since Solidity can't handle floating point numbers, the flow rate per unit is 0\n    - The pool distributes 0 tokens to each unit\n    - 200 tokens are left undistributed\n\nThese examples are extreme and almost never happen in practice. However, it is important to be aware of these limitations when designing your pools.\n\n:::tip How to design your pools?\nThe best way to design your pools is to make sure that the total flow rate or the tokens distributed are always orders of magnitude higher than the number of total units in the pool.\nThis way, you can be sure that the flow rate per unit will always be significantly higher than 0 and that all members will receive a share of the distribution.\n:::\n\n## About Pool Connections and Claiming\n\n### What is the difference between connecting to a pool and claiming tokens?\nAfter creating a pool and assigning units to pool members,\nthey need to connect to the pool or claim their Super Tokens in order for it to show on their balance.\nSimply assigning units (shares) to a member does not automatically reflect in their balance.\nThe accumulated tokens NEED to be claimed by the member (or a different address), or the member needs to connect to the pool\nto start receiving their share of the Super Token Distributions.\n\n### How can members collect their Distributions from the pool?\n\nThere are two ways for members to get their streamed or transferred Super Tokens from a pool:\n- **Connecting to the Pool (Recommended)**: Members should connect to the pool to start receiving their share of the Super Token Distributions in real time to their balance.\nThis includes both Instant Distributions and Streaming Distributions. In order to connect to the pool, the member should call the `connectPool` function from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-connectpool).\nThe address calling the function should be the address of the member. Other addresses will not be able to connect a member to the pool.\n\n- **Claiming the Tokens**: Members can claim their share of the Super Token Distributions accumulated from the pool at any time,\neven if they are not connected to the pool. As a matter of fact, anyone can claim the tokens on behalf of the member. To do so, the function\n`claimAll` from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-claimall) should be called with the address of the member as the argument.\n\n:::note Connecting to the pool includes claiming\nWhen a member connects to the pool, they automatically claim the accumulated tokens and start receiving the distributions in real time.\n:::\n\n:::tip Reminder\nWe use the `SuperTokenV1Library` to interact with the Superfluid protocol [on-chain](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/distributions-and-super-tokens/on-chain) (from your smart contracts),\nwhile we use the forwarders (eg. `GDAv1Forwarder`) to interact with the Superfluid protocol [off-chain](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/distributions-and-super-tokens/off-chain) (from your web3 frontend applications).\n:::\n\n:::tip Recommendation\nIt is recommended to prompt users to connect to the pool as soon as possible to start receiving the distributions in real time.\nDepending on your use case, periodic claiming may also offer the best UX, however pool connections usually offer\nthe best UX for real-time distributions.\n:::\n\n### How can members disconnect from the pool?\nMembers can always disconnect from the pool to stop receiving distributions in real time by calling the function `disconnectPool` from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-disconnectpool).\n\n### Example\n- **Jake** creates a pool and assigns 100 units to **Alice**, 200 units to **Bob**, and 200 units to **Charlie**.\n- **Alice** connects to the pool before any Distribution is made. Thus, she's able to receive her share of the Distributions in real time when they start.\n- **Jake** starts a stream of 100 tokens/second to the pool.\n- **Alice** receives 20 tokens/second directly into her balance, **Bob** and **Charlie** each accumulate 40 tokens/second in the pool.\n- After 100 seconds, **Alice** can already see 2000 tokens on her balance. **Bob** and **Charlie** are each eligible to get 4000 tokens, but they cannot see them on their balance just yet.\n- **Bob** chooses to claim every 100 seconds, while **Charlie** chooses to connect to the pool.\n- **Bob** receives periodically 4000 tokens every 100 seconds.\n- By connecting to the pool, **Charlie** automatically claims the accumulated tokens, but also starts receiving tokens in real time.\n\n\n## Important Functions\n\nHere are some of the most important functions for interacting with Superfluid pools:\n\n:::note Reminder\nSome of this functions are available via [`SuperTokenV1Library.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) (contracts using that lib) only.\n:::\n\n### createPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(ISuperToken token, address admin, PoolConfig memory poolConfig)\n```\n\nCreates a new pool with the specified admin, configuration and poolConfig.\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n:::warning Strong recommendation\nWe don't recommend setting `transferabilityForUnitsOwner` to `true` unless you have a specific use case that absolutely requires it. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.\n:::\n\nSuperTokenV1Library also provides overloaded variants setting default values for `admin` (default: `msg.sender`) and/or `poolConfig` (default: `{ transferabilityForUnitsOwner: false, distributionFromAnyAddress: true }`).\n\n### updateMemberUnits\n\nThis function is part of `ISuperfluidPool`, can thus be invoked on pool contracts.\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateMemberUnits(address memberAddress, uint128 newUnits)\n```\n\nUpdates the number of units a member has within a pool, effectively changing their share of future distributions.\n\n:::warning Important\nKeep in mind that the total amount of units in the pool needs to be significantly lower than the total flow rate or the total tokens distributed of the pool.\nTo understand more why this is the case, please refer to the [Member Units](#about-member-units) section.\n:::\n\n### claimAll\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, address memberAddress)\n```\n\nAllows a member to claim their share of the tokens from all previous distributions.\n\n### connectPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction connectPool(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\nConnects a pool member to a pool.\n\n:::tip About pool connections\nThe pool member needs to connect to a pool before the distribution balance is reflected in their net balance.\nIf the distribution starts before the user is connected to the pool, the user will still receive the tokens\nwhen they connect to the pool eventually.\n:::\n\n### disconnectPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction disconnectPool(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\nDisconnects a pool member from a pool.\n\n### distribute\n\n```solidity\nfunction distribute(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, uint256 requestedAmount)\n```\n\nDistributes a specified amount of tokens to the pool, to be shared among members according to their units.\n\n### distributeFlow\n\n```solidity\nfunction distributeFlow(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, int96 requestedFlowRate)\n```\n\nFlow-distributes with the specified flowrate to the pool, with the flow going to members according to their units.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use these functions within a smart contract to set up and manage a pool:\n\n```solidity\n// Assume ISuperToken and SuperfluidPool interfaces are imported and available.\n\ncontract MyPool {\n    Using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n    \n    ISuperToken private superToken;\n    ISuperfluidPool private pool;\n    \n    constructor(ISuperToken _superToken) {\n        superToken = _superToken;\n        // create a pool with default settings:\n        // msg.sender is admin, non-transferrable units, anybody can distribute to it\n        pool = superToken.createPool();\n    }\n\n    // Use updateMemberUnits to assign units to a member.\n    // (This will typically be a permissioned operation, it's akin to minting tokens)\n    function updateMemberUnits(address member, uint128 units) public {\n        pool.updateMemberUnits(member, units);\n    }\n\n    // Instant distribution of tokens to pool members proportional to their current units\n    function distribute(uint256 amount) public {\n        superToken.distribute(pool, amount);\n    }\n\n    // Flow distribution of tokens to pool members proportional to their current units\n    function distributeFlow(int96 flowRate) public {\n        superToken.distributeFlow(pool, flowRate);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyPool` creates a pool, adds a member, and makes an Instant Distribution (discreet transfer - through `distribute`) and a Streaming Distribution (continuous flow - through `distributeFlow`) using the functions from `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`.\n\n:::info Learn more about the `SuperTokenV1Library`\nFor more detailed information on the implementation and usage of `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`, refer to the [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n",

This guide follows the structure used for the `Superfluid` contract, adapting to the specifics of the `DistributionContract`.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving into testing your Superfluid contracts with Foundry, make sure you have set up your development environment properly. Here\'s a brief explanation of each step required:\n\n1. **Creating and Navigating to Your Project Directory**:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir superfluid-example && cd superfluid-example\n   ```\n\n   This command creates a new directory named `foundry-example` and then changes your current working directory to it.\n\n2. **Initializing a Foundry Project**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge init\n   ```\n\n   This initializes a new Foundry project in your directory, setting up the necessary structure and configuration for Ethereum smart contract development.\n\n3. **Installing Superfluid Protocol Dependencies**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install superfluid-protocol-monorepo=https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the `dev` branch of the Superfluid protocol from its GitHub repository.\n\n4. **Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.9.6 --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the necessary (4.9.X) of the OpenZeppelin contracts, which are widely used for secure smart contract development.\n\nThese steps ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed to start developing and testing your Superfluid-based contracts with Foundry.\n\n## Contract and Key Functions\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `DistributionContract`</summary> \n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicensed\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\n\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\n\nimport { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\nimport {IGeneralDistributionAgreementV1, ISuperfluidPool, PoolConfig} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/agreements/gdav1/IGeneralDistributionAgreementV1.sol";\n\nimport "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";\n\ninterface IFakeDAI is IERC20 {\n\n    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n}\n\ncontract DistributionContract {\n\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n    \n    mapping (address => bool) public accountList;\n\n    ISuperToken public daix;\n\n    ISuperfluidPool pool;\n\n    // fDAIx address on Polygon Mumbai = 0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f\n    constructor(ISuperToken _daix) {\n\n        daix = _daix;\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Mints 10,000 fDAI to this contract and wraps it all into fDAIx\n    function gainDaiX() external {\n\n        // Get address of fDAI by getting underlying token address from DAIx token\n        IFakeDAI fdai = IFakeDAI( daix.getUnderlyingToken() );\n        \n        // Mint 10,000 fDAI\n        fdai.mint(address(this), 10000e18);\n\n        // Approve fDAIx contract to spend fDAI\n        fdai.approve(address(daix), 20000e18);\n\n        // Wrap the fDAI into fDAIx\n        daix.upgrade(10000e18);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev creates a Pool with this contract being the admin\n    function createPool(ISuperToken token, PoolConfig memory poolConfig) external {\n\n        // Create Pool\n        pool=daix.createPool(token, address(this), poolConfig);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev updates Units for a specific member\n    function updateMemberUnits(address memberAddress, uint128 newUnits) external {\n\n        // Update member units\n        pool.updateMemberUnits(memberAddress, newUnits);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev creates a stream from this contract to the pool\n    function createStreamToPool(int96 flowRate) external {\n\n        // Create stream\n        daix.createFlow(receiver, flowRate);\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n</p> </details> </div>\n\n* **gainDaiX**: Mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx.\n* **createPool**: Initiates a new Superfluid pool with this contract as the admin.\n* **updateMemberUnits**: Updates units for a specific pool member.\n* **createStreamToPool**: Creates a money stream from this contract to the pool.\n\n## Writing Tests\n\n### Setting Up Your Test Environment\n\nYour test environment will depend on where you would like to test your Superfluid application.\nYou can fork a public testnet where an instance of the Superfluid Protocol already exists (e.g Polygon Mumbai).

Here\'s how to test it:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testGainDaiX() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract with a mock fDAIx token\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n\n    // Action: Call the gainDaiX function\n    distributionContract.gainDaiX();\n\n    // Assertions: Check if the contract has the expected amount of fDAIx\n    uint256 balance = daix.balanceOf(address(distributionContract));\n    assertEq(balance, 10000e18, "The balance of fDAIx should be 10,000 after gainDaiX");\n}\n```\n\n#### CreatePool Function\n\nTo test `createPool`, you\'ll verify if a pool is created with the correct parameters:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testCreatePool() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract and mock tokens\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n\n    // Define pool configuration\n    PoolConfig memory poolConfig;\n    // Set poolConfig parameters...\n\n    // Action: Call the createPool function\n    distributionContract.createPool(daix, poolConfig);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify if the pool is created correctly\n    ISuperfluidPool pool = distributionContract.pool();\n    // Additional assertions about pool...\n}\n```\n\n#### UpdateMemberUnits Function\n\nTesting `updateMemberUnits` involves checking if member units in a pool are updated correctly:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testUpdateMemberUnits() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract, create a pool, and add members\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n    // Create pool...\n    address memberAddress = address(new Member());\n\n    // Action: Update member units\n    uint128 newUnits = 100;\n    distributionContract.updateMemberUnits(memberAddress, newUnits);\n\n    // Assertions: Check if the member\'s units are updated\n    uint128 updatedUnits = daix.getMemberUnits(memberAddress);\n    assertEq(updatedUnits, newUnits, "Member units should be updated to the new value");\n}\n```\n\n#### CreateStreamToPool Function\n\nFor `createStreamToPool`, you\'ll need to ensure that a stream is correctly established:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testCreateStreamToPool() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract and create a pool\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n    // Create pool...\n\n    // Action: Create a stream to the pool\n    int96 flowRate = 1000;\n    distributionContract.createStreamToPool(flowRate);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify the stream is created with the correct flow rate\n    // Implement checks for stream creation...\n}\n```\n\n### Using Cheat Codes\n\nFoundry\'s cheat codes can simulate various scenarios. Here\'s an example of using a cheat code to test access control:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testUnauthorizedAccess() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(...);\n\n    // Use cheat codes to simulate an unauthorized user\n    vm.prank(address(0x123));\n    vm.expectRevert("Unauthorized access");\n\n    // Attempt to call a function that requires specific permissions\n    distributionContract.someFunctionRequiringAuthorization();\n}\n\n## Running Tests\n\nExecute your tests using the following command:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* Write clear, descriptive test cases.\n* Maintain code readability.\n* Use Foundry cheat codes for simulating real-world scenarios.\n* Aim for high test coverage.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting ensures the reliability and security of blockchain contracts. This guide provides a foundational approach for using Foundry to test the `DistributionContract`.\n\n## Further Resources\n\n* [Foundry Book](https://foundry.readthedocs.io)\n',

Traditional models often involve complex, non-transparent payment structures and lack real-time interaction capabilities. Our DApp aims to address these challenges by using Distributions from Superfluid Protocol for seamless transactions and fair distribution of advertising revenues.\n\nThis example addresses the following Superfluid Protocol features:\n\n- [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview)\n- [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools)\n- [Super Apps](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/super-apps/deploy-a-super-app)\n\n:::tip Check out the full codebase\nFor the complete implementation of the DApp, including the smart contract and foundry test, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/ad-auction-example).\n:::\n\n### The Problem\n\nThe main challenges in current digital advertising models include:\n\n1. **Lack of Transparency**: Difficulty in tracking funds and understanding distribution mechanisms.\n2. **Inefficient Payment Systems**: Cumbersome processes for handling and distributing advertising revenue.\n3. **Static Advertisement Bidding**: Traditional models don't allow real-time bidding, leading to less engagement and fairness.\n\n\n### Our Solution\n\nOur DApp introduces a novel approach to advertisement auctioning:\n\n- **Continuous Funds Stream**: Utilizing Superfluid's money streaming concept, funds flow continuously into a distribution pool.\n- **Dynamic Advertisement Auctioning**: Advertisers bid for ad space in real-time through streaming payments, creating an engaging and fair auction system.\n- **Proportional Distribution**: Funds are distributed between the DApp owner and previous advertisers based on their advertising duration, ensuring fair compensation.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n<GdaSuperVis/>\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Visualization of our advertisement auction app mechanism*</p>\n</div>\n\n:::note\nIn the visualization above we see how the previous streamer joins the pool to become a new member and get money streamed to him\n:::\n\n### Smart Contract Structure\n\nThe `AdSpotContract` is at the heart of our DApp, built on Ethereum and integrated with Superfluid Protocol. It encompasses:\n\n- **Pool Creation and Management**: Facilities for users to create and administer distribution pools.\n- **Auction Mechanism**: Mechanisms for real-time bidding and advertisement space allocation.\n- **Fund Distribution Logic**: Automated and transparent distribution of funds between DApp owners and advertisers.\n- **Superfluid Integration**: Leveraging Superfluid's GDA for efficient streaming of funds.\n\nIn the following sections, we'll delve deeper into each aspect of the DApp, providing insights into the smart contract functionalities, implementation guide, and UI/UX considerations.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThis guide is intended for blockchain developers and assumes familiarity with Ethereum smart contract development and minimal familiarity with the concept of [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Smart Contract Implementation\n\nThe [`AdSpotContract`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/ad-auction-example/blob/master/src/AdSpotContract.sol) plays a crucial role in our DApp, integrating Superfluid's streaming capabilities for an innovative advertisement auction system. Let's dive into the key components and functionalities of this smart contract.\n\n### Contract Overview\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use the Superfluid Protocol's [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx) (also known as the GDA in our codebase) to develop a decentralized application (DApp) for advertisement auctioning. We'll walk through the key components of the `AdSpotContract`.\n\n## Contract Initialization\n\nThe `AdSpotContract` is initialized with necessary Superfluid interfaces and parameters. Here's a look at the constructor:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor(ISuperToken _acceptedToken)\n    CFASuperAppBase(ISuperfluid(_acceptedToken.getHost()))\n{\n    // Contract initialization code\n}\n```\n\nThis constructor sets up the Superfluid context and initializes the fund distribution pool.\n\n## Real-Time Auctioning Logic\n\nThe contract employs callback functions to manage auction logic. Here's an example of a callback function handling new flow creation:\n\n```solidity\nfunction onFlowCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address sender,\n    bytes calldata ctx\n) internal override returns (bytes memory newCtx) {\n    // Logic for handling new flow creation\n}\n```\n\nThese functions are crucial for updating the highest bidder and managing the distribution of shares.\n\n## NFT Showcase Feature\n\nThe contract also includes a feature for the highest bidder to showcase an NFT:\n\n```solidity\nfunction setNftToShowcase(address _nftAddress, uint256 _tokenId) external {\n    // NFT showcase logic\n}\n```\n\nThis feature adds interactivity to the advertisement space, allowing for dynamic content display.\n\n## Getters for Contract State\n\nVarious getter functions provide important information about the contract's state:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getHighestBidder() public view returns (address) {\n    // Logic to retrieve the highest bidder\n}\n```\n\nThese functions are essential for users to interact with and understand the contract's current state.\n\n<Admonition type=\"info\">\n\nFor a complete code base and tests of the `AdSpotContract`, refer to the [full contract code](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/ad-auction-example/).\n\n</Admonition>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis guide provided a high-level overview of the `AdSpotContract` used in a DApp for advertisement auctioning with Superfluid. The contract demonstrates a real-time auction mechanism, a dynamic NFT showcase feature, and efficient fund distribution using Superfluid's streaming capabilities.",
      "---\nsidebar_position: 2\n---\n\nimport StakingContract from '@site/src/components/StakingContract';\n\n# Staking Platform\n\nThis guide explores the development of a staking platform, leveraging the capabilities of Superfluid's [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx) (also called the *General Distributions Agreement - GDA*).\n\n\n<StakingContract/>\n\n\n## Repository\n\nThe contract and associated tests can be found in the [SuperfluidStaking Repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/sf-example-staking).\n\n## Contract Architecture\n\nThe SuperfluidStaking system consists of two main contracts:\n\n1. **SuperfluidStaking**: The core contract that manages staking, unstaking, and reward distribution.\n2. **ClaimContract**: An auxiliary contract created for each staker to manage their individual rewards.\n\n### SuperfluidStaking Contract\n\nThis contract is responsible for:\n\n- Accepting stakes from users\n- Managing the total staked amount\n- Creating and upgrading Super Tokens for rewards\n- Creating and managing a Superfluid pool for reward distribution\n- Handling the unstaking process\n- Facilitating reward claims\n\nKey components:\n\n- `underlyingStakedToken`: The ERC20 token that users stake\n- `underlyingRewardsToken`: The ERC20 token used for rewards\n- `superToken`: The Super Token wrapper for the rewards token\n- `pool`: The Superfluid pool used for distributing rewards\n- `scalingFactor`: A factor used to scale down staked amounts for precision\n\n### ClaimContract\n\nThis contract is created for each staker and is responsible for:\n\n- Claiming rewards from the Superfluid pool\n- Holding claimed rewards until withdrawn by the staker\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\nTo set up the development environment and run the tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Foundry**\n\n   Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development. To install Foundry, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\n   ```\n\n   Then, run `foundryup` in a new terminal session to install the latest version.\n\n2. **Clone the repository**\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/sf-example-staking\n   cd superfluid-staking\n   ```\n\n3. **Install dependencies**\n\n   Use Forge to install the necessary dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install\n   ```\n\n   This will install OpenZeppelin contracts and Superfluid contracts as specified in the `foundry.toml` file.\n\n4. **Compile the contracts**\n\n   ```bash\n   forge build\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the tests**\n\n   ```bash\n   forge test\n   ```\n\n   This will run all the test cases defined in the `test` directory.\n\n## Contract Interaction Flow\n\n1. **Deployment**: The contract is deployed with parameters for the staked token, rewards token, Superfluid token factory, and scaling factor.\n\n2. **Supplying Funds**: The contract owner calls `supplyFunds` to add rewards to the pool.\n\n3. **Staking**: Users call `stake` to deposit tokens. This creates a ClaimContract if they don't have one and updates their units in the Superfluid pool.\n\n4. **Unstaking**: Users call `unstake` to withdraw their staked tokens. This updates their units in the Superfluid pool.\n\n5. **Claiming Rewards**: Users call `claimRewards` to receive their accumulated rewards. This interacts with their ClaimContract to fetch and distribute rewards.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n- The use of a scaling factor is crucial for maintaining precision in reward calculations, especially when dealing with tokens of different decimals.\n- The ClaimContract pattern allows for efficient reward claiming without requiring frequent updates to the main contract.\n- The contract leverages Superfluid's streaming capabilities for continuous and gas-efficient reward distribution.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe test suite (located in `test/SuperfluidStaking.t.sol`) covers various scenarios including:\n\n- Staking and unstaking\n- Reward distribution and claiming\n- Multiple users interacting with the contract\n- Edge cases and potential vulnerabilities\n\nTo run a specific test:\n\n```bash\nforge test --match-test testFunctionName\n```\n\nReplace `testFunctionName` with the name of the test function you want to run.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SuperfluidStaking contract provides a robust and efficient system for stake-based reward distribution using Superfluid.\nBy following this guide, you should be able to understand the contract's architecture, set up your development environment, and run the tests.",

This splitting is determined by the `sideReceiverPortion` parameter, which defines the percentage of the incoming flow to be routed to the side receiver, with the remainder going to the main receiver.\n\n## Contract Overview\n\n<img src="/assets/diagram.png" alt="FlowSplitter Diagram"/>\n\n\nThe above diagram illustrates how the `FlowSplitter` works. For example, if the `sideReceiverPortion` is set to 30%, then 30% of all incoming Super Token streams will be routed to the side receiver, and the remaining 70% will go to the main receiver.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `FlowSender` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity 0.8.18;\n\n// Uncomment this line to use console.log\n// import "hardhat/console.sol";\n\nimport {SuperTokenV1Library} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\nimport {SuperAppBaseFlow} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperAppBaseFlow.sol";\nimport {\n    ISuperfluid,\n    ISuperToken\n} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\n\n/// @title FlowSplitter\n/// @author Superfluid | Modified by @0xdavinchee\n/// @dev A negative sideReceiverPortion portion is not allowed\n/// A portion > 1000 is fine though because the protocol will\n/// revert when trying to create a flow with a negative flow rate\n/// A flowRate which is less than 1000 will be rounded down to 0 and will revert\n/// Also an inflow which does not contain a whole number will be rounded down,\n/// this will also lead to a revert.\ncontract FlowSplitter is SuperAppBaseFlow {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    /// @dev Account that ought to be routed the majority of the inflows\n    address public immutable MAIN_RECEIVER;\n\n    /// @dev Account that ought to be routed the minority of the inflows\n    address public immutable SIDE_RECEIVER;\n\n    /// @dev Account that deployed the contract\n    address public immutable CREATOR;\n\n    /// @dev Super Token that the FlowSplitter will accept streams of\n    ISuperToken public immutable ACCEPTED_SUPER_TOKEN;\n\n    /// @dev number out of 1000 representing portion of inflows to be redirected to SIDE_RECEIVER\n    ///      Ex: 300 would represent 30%\n    int96 public sideReceiverPortion;\n\n    error INVALID_PORTION();\n    error SAME_RECEIVERS_NOT_ALLOWED();\n    error NO_SELF_FLOW();\n    error NOT_CREATOR();\n\n    /// @dev emitted when the split of the outflow to MAIN_RECEIVER and SIDE_RECEIVER is updated\n    event SplitUpdated(int96 mainReceiverPortion, int96 newSideReceiverPortion);\n\n    constructor(\n        ISuperfluid host_,\n        ISuperToken acceptedSuperToken_,\n        address creator_,\n        address mainReceiver_,\n        address sideReceiver_,\n        int96 sideReceiverPortion_\n    ) SuperAppBaseFlow(host_, true, true, true) {\n        if (sideReceiverPortion_ <= 0 || sideReceiverPortion_ == 1000) revert INVALID_PORTION();\n        if (mainReceiver_ == sideReceiver_) revert SAME_RECEIVERS_NOT_ALLOWED();\n        if (mainReceiver_ == address(this) || sideReceiver_ == address(this)) revert NO_SELF_FLOW();\n\n        ACCEPTED_SUPER_TOKEN = acceptedSuperToken_;\n        CREATOR = creator_;\n        MAIN_RECEIVER = mainReceiver_;\n        SIDE_RECEIVER = sideReceiver_;\n        sideReceiverPortion = sideReceiverPortion_;\n    }\n\n    /// @dev checks that only the acceptedToken is used when sending streams into this contract\n    /// @param superToken_ the token being streamed into the contract\n    function isAcceptedSuperToken(ISuperToken superToken_) public view override returns (bool) {\n        return superToken_ == ACCEPTED_SUPER_TOKEN;\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Returns the outflow rates to main and side receiver given flowRate_ and an arbitrary\n    /// sideReceiverPortion_\n    /// @dev If either returns 0, it will revert when trying to create a flow\n    ///     because the protocol does not allow creating flows with a flow rate of 0\n    ///     Also, if the sum of the two outflows is not equal to the inflow, it means the app will\n    ///     receive a residual flow.\n    /// @param flowRate_ the inflow rate\n    /// @param sideReceiverPortion_ the portion of the inflow to be redirected to SIDE_RECEIVER\n    /// @return mainFlowRate the outflow rate to MAIN_RECEIVER\n    /// @return sideFlowRate the outflow rate to SIDE_RECEIVER\n    /// @return residualFlowRate the residual flow rate\n    function getMainAndSideReceiverFlowRates(int96 flowRate_, int96 sideReceiverPortion_)\n        external\n        pure\n        returns (int96 mainFlowRate, int96 sideFlowRate, int96 residualFlowRate)\n    {\n        mainFlowRate = (flowRate_ * (1000 -

This adjusts the outflow rates to both receivers accordingly.\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateSplit(int96 newSideReceiverPortion_) external;\n```\n\n### Calculating Flow Rates\n\nTo calculate the exact outflow rates for the main and side receivers based on any inflow rate and `sideReceiverPortion`, use the `getMainAndSideReceiverFlowRates` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getMainAndSideReceiverFlowRates(\n    int96 flowRate_,\n    int96 sideReceiverPortion_\n) external pure returns (\n    int96 mainFlowRate,\n    int96 sideFlowRate,\n    int96 residualFlowRate\n);\n```\n\n### Handling Streams\n\nThe contract includes several internal callback functions that handle the creation, updating, and deletion of streams:\n\n* `onFlowCreated`: Called when a new inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is created.\n* `onFlowUpdated`: Called when an existing inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is updated.\n* `onFlowDeleted`: Called when an inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is deleted.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `FlowSplitter` smart contract offers a robust solution for automatically splitting incoming Super Token streams. By setting the `sideReceiverPortion`, users can determine the flow rates to different parties, enabling a fair and transparent distribution of funds.\n',

Import the library:\n   ```solidity\n   import "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n   ```\n\n2. Include the `using` statement:\n   ```solidity\n   using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n   ```\n\n:::tip Learn more about the SuperTokenV1Library\nFor more details on the SuperTokenV1Library, refer to the page [Using the SuperTokenV1Library](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/using-library). For a full list of its functions, refer to its [technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## Access Control in Superfluid\n\nAccess control is a crucial aspect of smart contract security, allowing certain addresses to perform specific actions.\nIn the context of Superfluid and money streaming, Access Control Lists (ACLs) enables one address (the Flow Operator) to manage streams on behalf of another address.\n\n### How Access Control Works in Superfluid\n\nSuperfluid implements a flexible permission system for flow management:\n\n1. **Granting Permissions**: An account can grant permissions to a flow operator, specifying what actions they can perform (create, update, delete flows) and setting a flow rate allowance.\n\n2. **Flow Rate Allowance**: This is the maximum net flow rate that the operator can create on behalf of the account.\n\n3. **Operator Actions**: Once granted permissions, the operator can perform the allowed actions within the specified flow rate allowance.\n\n:::tip Access Control for [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview)\nIn this document, we address Access Control for Money Streaming (CFA). Currently, there are no access control functions for [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview). However, you can build your own access control system using the SuperTokenV1Library functions.\n:::\n\n### Key Functions for Access Control\n\n1. `setFlowPermissions`: Set specific permissions for a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator,\n    bool allowCreate,\n    bool allowUpdate,\n    bool allowDelete,\n    int96 flowRateAllowance\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n2. `flowFrom`: Control a flow as an operator on behalf of another account.\n\n```solidity\nfunction flowFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n3. `revokeFlowPermissions`: Revoke all permissions from a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction revokeFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n:::tip Full list of functions\nFor a full list of functions related to access control, refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## User Data in Superfluid\n\nUser data in Superfluid allows developers to attach additional information to transactions. This can be used for various purposes, such as including metadata, triggering specific logic in receiver contracts, or implementing off-chain systems.\n\n### How to Use User Data\n\nMany functions in the SuperTokenV1Library accept a `userData` parameter. This is typically a `bytes` type, allowing you to encode any data you want to include.\n\nExample of using user data when controlling a flow:\n\n```solidity\nfunction flowFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    bytes memory userData\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nYou can encode various types of data into the `userData` parameter. For example:\n\n```solidity\nbytes memory userData = abi.encode(uint256(1234), "Hello, Superfluid!");\ncreateFlowWithUserData(token, receiver, flowRate, userData);\n```\n\n## Example: Granting Permissions and Creating a Flow\n\nHere\'s a simple example demonstrating how one contract can grant permissions to another, allowing it to create a flow on its behalf:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\nimport { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\ncontract PermissionGranter {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    function grantPermissions(\n        ISuperToken token,\n        address operator,\n        int96 flowRateAllowance\n    ) external {\n        token.setFlowPermissions(\n            operator,\n            true, // allowCreate\n            false, // allowUpdate\n            false, // allowDelete\n            flowRateAllowance\n        );\n    }\n}\n\ncontract FlowCreator {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    function createFlowAsOperator(\n        ISuperToken token,\n        address sender,\n        address receiver,\n        int96 flowRate\n    ) external {\n        token.flowFrom(sender, receiver, flowRate);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `PermissionGranter` can grant permissions to `FlowCreator`. Once permissions are granted, `FlowCreator` can create flows on behalf of the address that called `grantPermissions`.\n\nTo use these contracts:\n\n1. Deploy both contracts.\n2. Call `grantPermissions` on `PermissionGranter`, passing the token address, the address of the `FlowCreator` contract, and the desired flow rate allowance.\n3. Now, anyone can call `createFlowAsOperator` on `FlowCreator`, which will create a flow from the address that granted permissions to the specified receiver.\n\nThis setup allows for flexible delegation of flow creation, which can be useful in various DeFi applications, automated systems, or multi-sig wallet scenarios.',

It includes creating, updating, and deleting flows, **on chain, from another smart contracts**.\nThis guide does NOT cover:\n- How to create a flow by an operator on behalf of another account. For that, please refer to the [ACL and User Data guide](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/guides/acl-user-data).\n- How to manage flows with user data. For that, please refer to the [ACL and User Data guide](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/guides/acl-user-data).\n- How to create flows by interacting with the Money Streaming Forwarder contract from client applications. For that please refer to the [SDK section](/docs/sdk/money-streaming/create-update-delete-flow).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have:\n\n- Familiarity with Solidity.\n- Basic understanding of Superfluid and its functionalities.\n- Access to a development environment for deploying or interacting with Smart Contracts.\n- Importing the SuperTokenV1Library in your smart contract. For more details, refer to the [Using the SuperTokenV1Library](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/using-library).\n\n## What is a flow?\nIn Superfluid terminology, a flow is a continuous stream of tokens from one account to another.\nIt is a fundamental concept in the Superfluid protocol, enabling real-time, continuous payments between accounts.\n\n:::tip What is the difference between a "Stream" and a "Flow"?\nThis is a small technicality which is not necessarily important to understand.\nHowever, in Superfluid, a "Flow" is a more general term than a "Stream".\nA Stream is a non-zero flow, while a zero flow is not considered a Stream.\n:::\n\n## Set the flowrate\n\n### Function `flow`\n\nThis function sets the specified flowrate between sender and receiver.\n\n```\n/**\n    * @dev Sets the given CFA flowrate between the caller and a given receiver.\n    * If there\'s no pre-existing flow and `flowRate` non-zero, a new flow is created.\n    * If there\'s an existing flow and `flowRate` non-zero, the flowRate of that flow is updated.\n    * If there\'s an existing flow and `flowRate` zero, the flow is deleted.\n    * If the existing and given flowRate are equal, no action is taken.\n    * On creation of a flow, a "buffer" amount is automatically detracted from the sender account\'s available balance.\n    * If the sender account is solvent when the flow is deleted, this buffer is redeemed to it.\n    * @param token Super token address\n    * @param receiver The receiver of the flow\n    * @param flowRate The wanted flowrate in wad/second. Only positive values are valid here.\n    * @return bool\n    */\nfunction flow(ISuperToken token, address receiver, int96 flowRate)\n    internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n:::note when not using the lib\nThe CFAv1Forwarder contract has a function called `setFlowrate` which does the same.\n:::\n\n## CRUD methods\n\nIf you want to be more explicit when changing the state of flows, you can use the following CRUD methods:\n\n### Function: `createFlow`\n\nTo create a flow, you need to call `createFlow` by specifying the token, sender, receiver, and flow rate.\n\n```solidity\n/**\n * @dev Create flow\n * @param token The token used in flow\n * @param receiver The receiver of the flow\n * @param flowRate The desired flowRate\n */\nfunction createFlow(ISuperToken token, address receiver, int96 flowRate)\n    internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Function: `updateFlow`\n\nFor an existing flow, you can update the flow rate through the `updateFlow` function.\n\n```solidity\n/**\n * @dev Update flow\n * @param token The token used in flow\n * @param receiver The receiver of the flow\n * @param flowRate The desired flowRate\n */\nfunction updateFlow(ISuperToken token, address receiver, int96 flowRate)\n    internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Function: `deleteFlow`\n\nTo delete an eisting, you need to call `deleteFlow` and  specify the token, sender, and receiver.\n\n```solidity\n/**\n * @dev Delete flow without userData\n * @param token The token used in flow\n * @param sender The sender of the flow\n * @param receiver The receiver of the flow\n */\nfunction deleteFlow(ISuperToken token, address sender, address receiver)\n    internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n:::warning Can I update or delete a non-existent flow?\nNo, you cannot update or delete a non-existent flow. If a flow does not exist, the function will revert.\n:::\n\n:::tip Full list of functions\nFor a full list of functions related to creating, updating, and deleting flows, refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## Example: Control Flows\n\nFor this example, we\'ll use the `FlowSender` contract described in the [Quickstart](/docs/protocol/quickstart.mdx) as our example to demonstrate how to write a contract with creates, updates, deletes and reads flow data.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `FlowSender` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.23;\n\nimport "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\nimport { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\ninterface IFakeDAI is IERC20 {\n    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n}\n\ncontract FlowSender {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    mapping (address => bool) public accountList;\n    ISuperToken public daix;\n\n    // fDAIx address on Polygon Mumbai = 0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f\n    constructor(ISuperToken _daix) {\n        daix = _daix;\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Mints 10,000 fDAI to this contract and wraps it all into fDAIx\n    function gainDaiX() external {\n\n        // Get address of fDAI by getting underlying token address from DAIx token\n        IFakeDAI fdai = IFakeDAI( daix.getUnderlyingToken() );\n\n        // Mint 10,000 fDAI\n        fdai.mint(address(this), 10000e18);\n\n        // Approve fDAIx contract to spend fDAI\n        fdai.approve(address(daix), 20000e18);\n\n        // Wrap the fDAI into fDAIx\n        daix.upgrade(10000e18);\n    }\n\n    /// @dev controls a stream with the given flowrate between this contract and the desired receiver\n    function setStream(address receiver, int96 flowRate) external {\n        daix.flow(receiver, flowRate);\n    }\n\n    /// @dev get flow rate between this contract and the given receiver\n    function getFlowRate(address receiver) external view returns (int96 flowRate) {\n        return daix.getFlowRate(address(this), receiver);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nThis contract has a few functions:\n\n- **gainDaiX**: Mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx (Superfluid\'s wrapped token).\n- **setStream**: Controls a stream between the contract and a receiver\n- **getFlowRate**: Reads the current flow rate of a stream.\n\n:::tip About the `SuperTokenV1Library`\nAs you can see, the `FlowSender` contract uses the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) to interact with the Superfluid protocol.\nInstead of passing the token address to the functions, the contract uses `using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;` to access the functions directly.\nYou can learn more about how to use the `SuperTokenV1Library` in the [Using the SuperTokenV1Library](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/using-library) guide.\n:::',

Here\'s a brief explanation of each step required:\n\n1. **Creating and Navigating to Your Project Directory**:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir superfluid-example && cd superfluid-example\n   ```\n\n   This command creates a new directory named `foundry-example` and then changes your current working directory to it.\n\n2. **Initializing a Foundry Project**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge init\n   ```\n\n   This initializes a new Foundry project in your directory, setting up the necessary structure and configuration for Ethereum smart contract development.\n\n3. **Installing Superfluid Protocol Dependencies**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install superfluid-protocol-monorepo=https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the `dev` branch of the Superfluid protocol from its GitHub repository.\n\n4. **Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.9.6 --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the necessary (4.9.X) of the OpenZeppelin contracts, which are widely used for secure smart contract development.\n\nThese steps ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed to start developing and testing your Superfluid-based contracts with Foundry.\n\n## Contract and Key Functions\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `FlowSender` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicensed\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\n\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\n\nimport { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\nimport "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";\n// For deployment on Mumbai Testnet\n\ninterface IFakeDAI is IERC20 {\n\n    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n}\n\ncontract FlowSender {\n\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    mapping (address => bool) public accountList;\n\n    ISuperToken public daix;\n\n    // fDAIx address on Polygon Mumbai = 0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f\n    constructor(ISuperToken _daix) {\n\n        daix = _daix;\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Mints 10,000 fDAI to this contract and wraps it all into fDAIx\n    function gainDaiX() external {\n\n        // Get address of fDAI by getting underlying token address from DAIx token\n        IFakeDAI fdai = IFakeDAI( daix.getUnderlyingToken() );\n\n        // Mint 10,000 fDAI\n        fdai.mint(address(this), 10000e18);\n\n        // Approve fDAIx contract to spend fDAI\n        fdai.approve(address(daix), 20000e18);\n\n        // Wrap the fDAI into fDAIx\n        daix.upgrade(10000e18);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev creates a stream from this contract to desired receiver at desired rate\n    function createStream(int96 flowRate, address receiver) external {\n\n        // Create stream\n        daix.createFlow(receiver, flowRate);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev updates a stream from this contract to desired receiver to desired rate\n    function updateStream(int96 flowRate, address receiver) external {\n\n        // Update stream\n        daix.updateFlow(receiver, flowRate);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev deletes a stream from this contract to desired receiver\n    function deleteStream(address receiver) external {\n\n        // Delete stream\n        daix.deleteFlow(address(this), receiver);\n\n    }\n\n    /// @dev get flow rate between this contract to certain receiver\n    function readFlowRate(address receiver) external view returns (int96 flowRate) {\n\n        // Get flow rate\n        return daix.getFlowRate(address(this), receiver);\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\n- **gainDaiX**: Mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx (Superfluid\'s wrapped token).\n- **createStream**: Initiates a new money stream to a specified receiver.\n- **updateStream**: Updates an existing money stream\'s flow rate.\n- **deleteStream**: Terminates an existing money stream.\n- **readFlowRate**: Reads the current flow rate of a stream.\n\n## Writing Tests\n\n### Setting Up Your Test Environment\n\nYour test environment will depend on where you would like to test your Superfluid application.\nYou can fork a public testnet where an instance of the Superfluid Protocol already exists (e.g Polygon Mumbai). In this case, you do not need to deploy a new instance of the Superfluid protocol.\nHowever, if you are testing on a local testnet you would need to deploy a new instance of the Superfluid protocol.\n\n<Tabs\n    defaultValue="testnet"\n    values={[\n        { label: \'Forked Testnet\', value: \'testnet\' },\n        { label: \'Local Net\', value: \'localnet\' },\n    ]}\n>\n\n<TabItem value="testnet">\n\n- Create a new Solidity file for your tests\n- Import `forge-std/Test.sol` and inherit from `Test`.\n- Import the Superfluid protocol contracts.\n- Write your `setUp` function to run before each test case.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\nimport "forge-std/Test.sol";\nimport {ISuperfluid, ISuperToken} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\nimport {TestGovernance, Superfluid, ConstantFlowAgreementV1, CFAv1Library, SuperTokenFactory} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeploymentSteps.sol";\nimport {SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol";\nimport {SuperTokenV1Library} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\ncontract FlowSenderTest is Test {\n    // Test contract instance\n    FlowSender flowSender;\n    // Mumbai fork parameters\n    uint256 mumbaiFork;\n    // Set up your environment variables and include MUMBAI_RPC_URL\n    string MUMBAI_RPC_URL = vm.envString("MUMBAI_RPC_URL");\n\n    // Setup function to initialize test environment\n    function setUp() public {\n\n        //Forking and selecting the Mumbai testnet\n        mumbaiFork = vm.createSelectFork(MUMBAI_RPC_URL);\n\n        //Pointing to the fake Daix contract on Mumbai\n        //For token and protocol addresses on all networks, check out the Superfluid Explorer: https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/\n        daix = ISuperToken(0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f);\n\n        //Deploy the contract\n        vm.prank(address(0x123)); // Simulate a different caller\n        flowSender=new FlowSender(daix);\n        vm.unprank(); // Restore the caller\n\n        //Add other functions and test contracts...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="localnet">\n- Create a new Solidity file for your test.\n- Import `forge-std/Test.sol` and inherit from `Test`.\n- Import the Superfluid protocol contracts.\n- Deploy a new instance of the Superfluid Protocol in the `setUp` function.\n- Create and Deploy a new instance of your test contract.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\nimport "forge-std/Test.sol";\nimport {ISuperfluid} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\nimport {SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer,\n    TestGovernance,\n    Superfluid,\n    ConstantFlowAgreementV1,\n    CFAv1Library,\n    SuperTokenFactory\n} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.sol";\n\n\ncontract FlowSenderTest is Test {\n    // Test contract instance\n    FlowSender flowSender;\n    //Set up your Superfluid framework\n    struct Framework {\n        TestGovernance governance;\n        Superfluid host;\n        ConstantFlowAgreementV1 cfa;\n        CFAv1Library.InitData cfaLib;\n        InstantDistributionAgreementV1 ida;\n        IDAv1Library.InitData idaLib;\n        SuperTokenFactory superTokenFactory;\n    }\n\n    SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer.Framework sf;\n\n    // Setup function to initialize test environment\n    function setUp() public {\n        address public owner;\n\t    //DEPLOYING THE FRAMEWORK\n        SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer sfDeployer = new SuperfluidFrameworkDeployer();\n        sfDeployer.deployTestFramework();\n        sf = sfDeployer.getFramework();\n\n\t    // DEPLOYING DAI and DAI wrapper super token\n\n\t    ISuperToken daix = sfDeployer.deployWrapperToken(\n\t    "Fake DAI", "DAI", 18, 10000000000000\n\t    );\n\n        // Initialize your contract here\n        flowSender = new FlowSender(\n            daix\n        );\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n:::tip About the `setUp` Function\nThe `setUp` function is an **optional** function standardized by Foundry (but it is necessary here, especially in the case of local testnet). It is a special function that is executed before each test case. It is used to initialize the test environment and contract instances.\nTo learn more about the `setUp` function, check out the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests).\n:::\n\n### Testing Contract Functions\n\n#### GainDaiX Function\n\nLet\'s write a test for the `gainDaiX` function in the `FlowSender` contract:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testGainDaiX() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the FlowSender contract\n    IFakeDAI fdai = new FakeDAI();\n    ISuperToken daix = new SuperToken(address(fdai));\n    FlowSender flowSender = new FlowSender(daix);\n\n    // Action: Call the gainDaiX function\n    flowSender.gainDaiX();\n\n    // Assertions: Check if the contract has the expected amount of DAIx\n    uint256 balance = daix.balanceOf(address(flowSender));\n    assertEq(balance, 10000e18, "The balance of DAIx should be 10,000 after gainDaiX");\n}\n```\n\n#### CreateStream Function\n\nNow, let\'s test the `createStream` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testCreateStream() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the FlowSender contract and create a receiver address\n    IFakeDAI fdai = new FakeDAI();\n    ISuperToken daix = new SuperToken(address(fdai));\n    FlowSender flowSender = new FlowSender(daix);\n    address receiver = address(new Receiver());\n\n    // Setup: Define a flow rate\n    int96 flowRate = 1000; // Example flow rate\n\n    // Action: Call the createStream function\n    flowSender.createStream(flowRate, receiver);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify if the stream is created with correct parameters\n    (,int96 outFlowRate,,) = daix.getFlow(address(flowSender), receiver);\n    assertEq(outFlowRate, flowRate, "The flow rate should match the specified rate");\n}\n\n```\n\n### Using Cheat Codes\n\nFoundry\'s cheat codes can simulate various blockchain states and interactions. For example, to test the `deleteStream` function, you might want to simulate different account permissions:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testDeleteStream() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the FlowSender contract and create a receiver address\n    IFakeDAI fdai = new FakeDAI();\n    ISuperToken daix = new SuperToken(address(fdai));\n    FlowSender flowSender = new FlowSender(daix);\n    address receiver = address(new Receiver());\n\n    // Setup: Create a stream first\n    flowSender.createStream(1000, receiver);\n\n    // Use cheat codes to simulate different account permissions\n    // Attempt to delete a stream with an unauthorized user\n    vm.prank(address(0x123)); // Simulate a different caller\n    vm.expectRevert("Unauthorized"); // Expect a revert due to unauthorized access\n    flowSender.deleteStream(receiver);\n\n    // Action: Attempt to delete a stream with the correct permission\n    flowSender.deleteStream(receiver);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify the stream is deleted\n    (,int96 outFlowRate,,) = daix.getFlow(address(flowSender), receiver);\n    assertEq(outFlowRate, 0, "The flow rate should be zero after deletion");\n}\n\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTo execute your tests, use:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Write clear and descriptive test cases.\n- Ensure code readability for easier maintenance.\n- Use Foundry cheat codes to simulate real-world scenarios.\n- Strive for high test coverage to capture a wide range of use cases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting is crucial in blockchain development for ensuring contract reliability and security, especially for complex protocols like Superfluid. This guide provides a foundation for using Foundry to write and run effective tests.\n\n## Further Resources\n\n- [Foundry Book](https://foundry.readthedocs.io)\n',

This page provides an in-depth overview of Money Streaming and the unique aspects of Flow NFTs in the Superfluid ecosystem.\n\n## What is Money Streaming?\n\nMoney Streaming allows for continuous, per-second token transfers between accounts, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to token distribution.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Perpetual Transfers**: Streams continue until canceled by the sender or the sender\'s balance depletes.\n- **Flexible Management**: Streams can be created, updated, or deleted at any time by the sender.\n\nFor a more conceptual breakdown, refer to the [detailed Money Streaming overview](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx).\n\n## Flows and Flow Rates\n\nMoney Streaming in Superfluid introduces the concepts of flows and flow rates, key elements for managing the continuous movement of tokens. This section defines these concepts and explains how to calculate flow rates accurately.\n\nFlows in Superfluid represent the continuous, per-second movement of tokens between accounts. They are defined by their flow rate and can be dynamically managed by the sender.\n\n:::tip\n\nYou may have a hard time seeing the difference between "Flows" and "Streams". This is a feature, not a bug. The key difference is the following: Flows can be equal to 0, while Streams need to be strictly positive.\n\n:::\n\nFlows have the following Characteristics:\n\n- **Perpetual**: Flows continue until the sender decides to cancel or the balance depletes.\n- **Flexible**: Flows can be created, updated, or stopped at any time.\n\n### Calculating Flow Rates\n\n\nFlow rates dictate the speed at which tokens are transferred per second. Superfluid requires these rates to be specified in wei per second.\n\nIt\'s crucial to translate your desired flow rate into wei per second accurately. Incorrect calculations can lead to discrepancies between expected and actual flow rates as displayed on the Superfluid Dashboard and Explorer.\n\n<Admonition type="info" title="Flow Rate Conversion">\n\nFlow rates can be reframed from larger time denominations like months or years into wei per second. Understand the conversion process to accurately determine the wei/second rate for your flows.\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Calculation Examples\n\n#### From Month to Wei/Second\n\n- **Monthly Rate**: 10 DAIx/month.\n- **Calculation**: 10 DAIx / ((365/12) * 24 * 60 * 60) = 3805175038052 wei/second.\n\n#### From Year to Wei/Second\n\n- **Yearly Rate**: 100 DAIx/year.\n- **Calculation**: 100 DAIx / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 3170979198376 wei/second.\n\n<Admonition type="warning" title="Calculation Precision">\n\nUsing an approximate number of days in a month (like 30 days) for calculations can lead to slightly inaccurate wei/second rates, affecting how the rate appears on Superfluid interfaces.\n\n</Admonition>\n\nThis section provides a clear understanding of flows and flow rates within the Superfluid Money Streaming, enabling users to accurately manage and interpret their token streams.',

Super Tokens have special capabilities.\nOne of them allows to create second-by-second token transfers (called [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx)).\nIn this guide, we\'ll walk through the process of setting up and deploying a basic vesting contract which deploys a Mock Super Token and creates a stream to a recipient.\n\nThis contract allows you to:\n- Deploy a Mock Super Token\n- Create, update or delete money streams\n\n:::note Why this Quickstart?\nThis is just an example to get you started with Superfluid. You can use this as a base to build more complex applications.\n\nYou DO NOT need to follow this quickstart guide in order to create, update and delete streams. You can do this directly from the [Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/) or by interacting with the [CFAv1Forwarder contract](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- The [Superfluid Simple Vesting Contract Repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-boilerplate)\n- A development environment *(Remix or Foundry)*\n- A testnet wallet (in case you want to deploy the contract to a testnet) *(e.g., MetaMask)*\n\n\n## Contract Overview: SuperfluidBoilerplate\n\nIn this guide we will describe the contract [`SuperfluidVesting.sol`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-quickstart/blob/master/src/SuperfluidVesting.sol):\n- This contract is designed to interact with the Superfluid protocol, specifically to deploy a [Super Token](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/overview) and use [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx).\n- The contract enables the deployment of a Mock Super Token in the constructor.\n- This contract enables the creation, modification, and deletion of continuous money streams to the a recipient.\n\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\' }}>\n<FlowSenderVis/>\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\' }}>\n    <p>*Visualization showing the vesting contract streaming tokens to users*</p>\n</div>\n\n\n### Contract and Key Functions\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `SuperfluidBoilerplate` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\nimport {SuperTokenV1Library, ISuperToken, ISuperfluid} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\nimport {ISuperTokenFactory} from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperTokenFactory.sol";\nimport {PureSuperTokenProxy, IPureSuperToken} from "./PureSuperToken.sol";\n\n/// @title SuperfluidVesting\n/// @notice A contract for managing token vesting using Superfluid streams\n/// @dev Uses SuperTokenV1Library for handling Superfluid token operations\ncontract SuperfluidVesting {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    /// @notice The Super Token that will be used for vesting\n    ISuperToken public acceptedSuperToken;\n    /// @notice The Superfluid protocol host contract\n    ISuperfluid public host;\n    /// @notice The address of the contract owner\n    address public owner;\n\n    /// @notice Restricts function access to contract owner\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Initializes the vesting contract\n    /// @param _host The address of the Superfluid host contract\n    /// @dev Assigns the host and owner addresses\n    /// Creates a new PureSuperToken and initializes it with mock data\n    /// Mints the total supply of the token to the contract\n    constructor(ISuperfluid _host) {\n        host = _host;\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        acceptedSuperToken = IPureSuperToken(address(new PureSuperTokenProxy()));\n        PureSuperTokenProxy(payable(address(acceptedSuperToken))).initialize(\n            ISuperTokenFactory(host.getSuperTokenFactory()),\n            "Mock Super Token",\n            "mST",\n            address(this),\n            1000000000000000000000000\n        );\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Creates or updates a vesting stream for a recipient\n    /// @param recipient The address that will receive the stream\n    /// @param flowRate The rate at which tokens will be streamed (tokens per second)\n    /// @dev Flow rate must be positive and contract must have sufficient balance\n    function setVesting(address recipient, int96 flowRate) public onlyOwner {\n        require(flowRate > 0, "Flow rate must be greater than 0");\n        require(acceptedSuperToken.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0, "Insufficient balance");\n        acceptedSuperToken.flow(recipient, flowRate);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\n\nThe contract has two main methods:\n\n- **constructor**: Creates a new contract and with it it deploys a Mock Super Token with 1,000,000 units initial supply minted to the contract.\n- **setVesting**: Creates, updates or deletes a stream to the user with the specified flow rate, gated by the modifier `onlyOwner`.\n\n\n## Environment Setup and Deployment\n\n<Tabs>\n  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix IDE" default>\n\n### Using Remix IDE\n\n1. **Create Files**: \n   -

This is a simple custom Super Token implementation.\n\n### Understanding the Contract\n\nThe `PureSuperToken.sol` file contains the contract for our Pure Super Token:\n\n```solidity\ncontract PureSuperTokenProxy is CustomSuperTokenBase, UUPSProxy {\n    function initialize(\n        ISuperTokenFactory factory,\n        string memory name,\n        string memory symbol,\n        address receiver,\n        uint256 initialSupply\n    ) external {\n        ISuperTokenFactory(factory).initializeCustomSuperToken(address(this));\n        ISuperToken(address(this)).initialize(\n            IERC20(address(0)),\n            18,\n            name,\n            symbol\n        );\n        ISuperToken(address(this)).selfMint(receiver, initialSupply, \"\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract creates a new `UUPSProxy` which is initialized as a Pure Super Token. The `initialize` function sets up the token using the `SuperTokenFactory` and mints the initial supply to the specified receiver.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test the Pure Super Token, run:\n\n```bash\nforge test --match testDeploy testSuperTokenBalance\n```\n\nThis will execute the tests in `PureSuperToken.t.sol`, which include deploying the token and checking the receiver's balance.\n\n### Deployment\n\nTo deploy the Pure Super Token, use the following Foundry command:\n\n```bash\nforge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --etherscan-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --verify --via-ir src/PureSuperToken.sol:PureSuperTokenProxy\n```\n\nReplace `<RPC_URL>`, `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>`, and `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual values.\n\n### Initialization\n\nAfter deployment, you need to initialize the token by calling the `initialize` function with the appropriate parameters:\n\n```solidity\npureSuperToken.initialize(\n    superTokenFactory,\n    \"MyToken\",\n    \"MTK\",\n    initialReceiver,\n    initialSupply\n);\n```\n\n## Example 2: Bridged Super Token\n\nThe Bridged Super Token is a more complex example that includes additional functionality for cross-chain operations.\n\n### Understanding the Contract\n\nThe `BridgedSuperToken.sol` file contains the contract for our Bridged Super Token. This implementation includes features like minting and burning limits for bridges.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test the Bridged Super Token, run:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nThis will execute the tests in `BridgedSuperTokenTest.t.sol`, which cover various aspects of the token's functionality, including limit setting, minting, and burning.\n\n### Deployment and Initialization\n\nThe deployment and initialization process for the Bridged Super Token is similar to the Pure Super Token. Use the `forge create` command for deployment, and then call the `initialize` function to set up the token.\n\n## Creating Your Own Custom Super Token\n\nWhen creating your own custom Super Token, you can use the following functions from the [ISuperToken Interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken)\n\n### `selfMint`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfMint(\n    address account,\n    uint256 amount,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function mints new tokens for the specified account. If `userData` is not empty, it invokes the `tokensReceived` hook according to ERC777 semantics.\n\n### `selfBurn`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfBurn(\n    address account,\n    uint256 amount,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function burns existing tokens for the specified account. If `userData` is not empty, it invokes the `tokensToSend` hook according to ERC777 semantics.\n\n### `selfTransferFrom`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfTransferFrom(\n    address sender,\n    address spender,\n    address recipient,\n    uint256 amount\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function transfers tokens from the `sender` to the `recipient`. If `spender` isn't the same as `sender`, it checks if `spender` has allowance to spend tokens of `sender`.\n\n### `selfApproveFor`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfApproveFor(\n    address account,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 amount\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function gives `spender` the `amount` allowance to spend the tokens of `account`.\n\nThese functions allow you to customize the behavior of your Super Token while maintaining compatibility with the Superfluid protocol.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following this guide, you should now be able to deploy and initialize custom Super Tokens for the Superfluid protocol. Remember to thoroughly test your custom implementations and consider the security implications of any additional functionality you add to your tokens.\n\nFor more information on Custom Super Tokens, check out the [Custom Super Token Wiki](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/About-Custom-Super-Token) and the [Deploy a Custom Super Token Guide](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-custom-super-token).",

      '---\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\n# Using the SuperTokenV1Library\n\nThe [SuperTokenV1Library](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol) is the primary interface for developers to interact with the Superfluid protocol\nwhen building smart contracts on-chain.\n\nThis comprehensive library provides all the necessary tools to work with the two main primitives of the Superfluid protocol:\n[Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview) (also called *Constant Flow Agreement* or *CFA*)\nand [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview) (also called *General Distributions Agreement* or *GDA*).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use the SuperTokenV1Library in your smart contract, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the library in your contract:\n\n```solidity\nimport "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n```\n\n2. Include the `using` statement in your contract:\n\n```solidity\nusing SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n```\n\n:::note about Native Super Tokens\nFor Native Super Tokens, use `using SuperTokenV1Library for ISETH;` instead.\n:::\n\n:::tip Technical Reference\nFor more details on the full list of functions and usage, refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nThe SuperTokenV1Library revolves around two main primitives:\n\n1. **Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)**: This represents Money Streaming functionality.\n2. **General Distributions Agreement (GDA)**: This handles Distribution Pools.\n\nThe library provides functions for various operations within these primitives:\n\n- Writing to the protocol (e.g., creating flows, updating flows, creating pools)\n- Reading from the protocol (e.g., getting flow rates)\n- Access control (allowing other wallets to control flow rates)\n- Attaching user data to blockchain function calls\n\n## Key Functions\n\nLet\'s explore some example functions in the SuperTokenV1Library:\n\n### Money Streaming (CFA) Functions\n\nThe library provides a wide range of functions for managing money streams, including creating, updating, and deleting flows. For example:\n\n#### Creating a Flow\n\n```solidity\nfunction createFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    bytes memory userData\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nThis function creates a new money stream. You can omit the `userData` parameter if not needed.\n\n#### Getting Flow Information\n\n```solidity\nfunction getFlowInfo(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver\n) internal returns (\n    uint256 lastUpdated,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    uint256 deposit,\n    uint256 owedDeposit\n)\n```\n\nThis function retrieves detailed information about a specific flow.\n\n### Distribution Pools (GDA) Functions\n\nBy the same token, the library provides functions for managing distribution pools, including creating pools and claiming distributions:\n\n#### Creating a Pool\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    address admin,\n    struct PoolConfig poolConfig\n) \n    internal \n    returns (contract ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n#### Claiming tokens\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    contract ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress\n) \n    internal \n    returns (bool)\n```\nThis function allows a member to claim all tokens to all the members of the pool.\n\n\n### Access Control Functions\n\nThe library also provides functions for managing access control and permissions between different wallet addresses and smart contracts:\n\n#### Setting Flow Permissions\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator,\n    bool allowCreate,\n    bool allowUpdate,\n    bool allowDelete,\n    int96 flowRateAllowance\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nThis function allows you to grant specific permissions to another address (flowOperator) to manage flows on your behalf.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Context-Aware Functions\n\nFor more advanced use cases including with [Super Apps](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/super-apps/understand-super-apps), the library provides context-aware versions of many functions. These are useful when you need to chain multiple operations or when working within the context of a Superfluid callback:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createFlowFromWithCtx(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    bytes memory ctx\n) internal returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n```\n\n### User Data\n\nMany functions in the SuperTokenV1Library allow you to attach user data to your transactions. This can be useful for adding metadata or triggering specific logic in receiver contracts.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Always check return values of functions to ensure operations were successful.\n2. Be mindful of gas costs, especially when working with multiple flows or large distribution pools.\n3. Use the appropriate permissions and access control functions to ensure the security of your contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SuperTokenV1Library is a powerful tool for interacting with the Superfluid protocol on-chain, in order to build smart contracts. By leveraging its functions for money streaming and distribution pools, you can create sophisticated blockchain applications with real-time finance capabilities. Always refer to the latest documentation and test thoroughly to ensure your implementation is correct and secure.',

Super Tokens exist in two primary forms: Wrapper and Pure.\n\n\n\n## Real-Time Balance\n\nSuper Tokens revolutionize balance calculations by combining traditional static balances with dynamic, real-time adjustments based on streams and distributions, leading to a more fluid representation of an account's value.\n\nCharacteristics of Super Tokens:\n\n* **Static Balance**: Reflects the conventional ERC20 balance, representing the basic, unchanging part of an account's value.\n* **Real-Time Balances**: Incorporates fluctuations from streams and distributions, adjusting the balance with each block to reflect ongoing financial activities. When you call the method `balanceOf()` on a Super Token, you get a real-time balance.\n* **Complex Calculation**: Unlike conventional tokens, `balanceOf()` method in Super Tokens doesn't just retrieve a stored value; it performs complex calculations based on numerous parameters to give the real time balance.\n* **Ongoing Relationships**: These calculations consider the account's continuous relationships with others, making the balance more representative of the current financial state.\n* **Time-Sensitive**: In cases involving streams, the balance is further influenced by time, specifically through the timestamp of the latest block, making it sensitive to the passage of time.\n* **Dynamic Adjustment**: As a result, the balance is a \"real-time balance,\" capable of changing with every new block, independent of direct transactions affecting the account.\n\n## Types of Super Tokens\n\n<Tabs\n  defaultValue=\"wrapper\"\n  values={[\n    {label: 'Wrapper Super Tokens', value: 'wrapper'},\n    {label: 'Pure Super Tokens', value: 'pure'},\n    {label: 'Native Super Tokens', value: 'native'},\n  ]}>\n  <TabItem value=\"wrapper\">\n\n### 1. Wrapper Super Tokens\n\nWrapper Super Tokens are wrapped from existing ERC20 tokens to allow interaction with the Superfluid Protocol.\nThey are the most common currently and can be permissionlessly created for any ERC20 token.\n\n#### Wrapping & Unwrapping\n\n- **Wrapping**: Deposit ERC20 tokens into the Wrapper Super Token contract to mint an equivalent amount of Super Tokens.\n- **Unwrapping**: Burn Super Tokens to get back the underlying ERC20 tokens.\n\n\n#### When to use Custom Wrappers?\n\n- **Unconventional ERC-20**: Custom Wrapper Super Tokens are typically used when underlying ERC20 tokens have complex functionalities that standard wrappers can't handle.\n- **Additional Features**: They can also be used to add additional features to the Super Token which don't exist in the Super Token contract.\n\nFor detailed deployment steps and further information, visit the [Deploy a Super Token Page](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-wrapped-super-token.mdx).\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"pure\">\n\n### 2. Pure Super Tokens\n\nPure Super Tokens are independent of any underlying asset, inheriting all Superfluid functionalities directly.\n\n#### Customization\n\nPure Super Tokens can be customized with additional features like pre-minting, access control, and wallet whitelisting. They can be categorized as Governed or Independent, with Governed Pure Super Tokens recommended for alignment with Superfluid Protocol Governance.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on deploying Pure Super Tokens, refer to the [Pure Super Token Deployment](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-pure-super-token.mdx) section.\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"native\">\n\n### 3. Native Super Tokens\n\nNative Super Tokens are similar to wrappers but are designed for native assets like ETH, MATIC, or AVAX.

As opposed to the [EIP-4337](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction)\nwhich uses a Contract Account (CA) for abstraction, ERC-2771\nextends the capabilities of the Host by allowing a trusted forwarder to pass the original `msg.sender` to the host contract through the method `forwardBatchCall`.\n\n\n## Macro Forwarder Contract Overview\n\nIntroducing a simple and secure way for builders to define their own macros without needing to be directly trusted by the Superfluid host contract.\nThis approach simplifies on-chain logic for batch calls, reduces gas consumption and potentially ameliorates the front-end code, addressing atomicity issues.\nToday, Superfluid has a contract called [`MacroForwarder.sol`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/MacroForwarder.sol)\n which is a trusted forwarder for user-defined macro interfaces.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the `MacroForwarder` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n<CodeBlock language="solidity">{MacroForwarder}</CodeBlock>\n\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\n### Macro Forwarder Contract Address\n\nThe `MacroForwarder` contract has the same address on all networks:\n\n```bash\n0xFD0268E33111565dE546af2675351A4b1587F89F\n```\n\n### Macro Forwarder Contract ABI\n\nIn order to interact with the `MacroForwarder` contract from your client application, you can use the following ABI:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the `MacroForwarder` ABI</summary>\n<p>\n\n<CodeBlock language="json">{MacroForwarderABI}</CodeBlock>\n\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\n\n## How to use the Macro Forwarder\n\nIn order to understand how to use the `MacroForwarder` contract,\nwe will use an example contract called `MultiFlowDeleteMacro.sol` which allows us to batch call delete flow transactions from one account to multiple accounts for a specific Super Token:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` contract</summary>\n<p>\n<CodeBlock language="solidity">{MultiFlowDeleteMacro}</CodeBlock>\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nThe steps in order to use the `MacroForwarder` contract are as follows:\n1. Create a contract which inherit the User Defined Macro Interface\n2. Implement your Macro Interface\n3. Use the Macro Forwarder to batch call the transactions\n\n:::tip Get ready for tests and deployment\nCreating your own macro involves testing and deploying a smart contract. If you are not familiar with testing and deployment frameworks on the Ethereum Virtual Machine,\nyou should consider learning about [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).\n:::\n\n\n### 1. Create your contract and inherit the User Defined Macro Interface\n\nAs you may have noticed, the `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` contract inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface like so:\n\n```solidity\ncontract MultiFlowDeleteMacro is IUserDefinedMacro {\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis is an interface that defines the `buildBatchOperations` method. It is the only required method to be implemented in the contract that inherits it.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to create a new contract which inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\n\n### 2. Implement your Macro Interface\n\nThe `buildBatchOperations` method is the only required method to be implemented in the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\nThis method returns an array of `ISuperfluid.Operation[]` struct which will be consumed by the `MacroForwarder` contract. This struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct Operation {\n    operationType operationType;\n    address target;\n    bytes data;\n}\n```\n\nIn the example contract `MultiFlowDeleteMacro`, you can see that the `buildBatchOperations` method is implemented as follows:\n\n```solidity\nfunction buildBatchOperations(ISuperfluid host, bytes memory params, address msgSender) public virtual view\n        returns (ISuperfluid.Operation[] memory operations)\n    {\n        IConstantFlowAgreementV1 cfa = IConstantFlowAgreementV1(address(host.getAgreementClass(\n            keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n        )));\n\n        // parse params\n        (ISuperToken token, address[] memory receivers) =\n            abi.decode(params, (ISuperToken, address[]));\n\n        // construct batch operations\n        operations = new ISuperfluid.Operation[](receivers.length);\n        for (uint i = 0; i < receivers.length; ++i) {\n            bytes memory callData = abi.encodeCall(cfa.deleteFlow,\n                                                   (token,\n                                                    msgSender,\n                                                    receivers[i],\n                                                    new bytes(0) // placeholder\n                                                   ));\n            operations[i] = ISuperfluid.Operation({\n                operationType : BatchOperation.OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_AGREEMENT, // type\n                target: address(cfa),\n                data: abi.encode(callData, new bytes(0))\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n\n:::warning About the method `getParams`\nThe `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` example contract contains a method called `getParams`. This method is not required to be implemented in the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\nHowever, it is highly recommended to implement this method in order to parse the parameters of the macro on the front-end.\n\nThis method is simply implemented by encoding the parameters that will be used to call the method `runMacro`from `MacroForwarder` contract. It is usually one line of code as such:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getParams(ISuperToken token, address[] memory receivers) public pure returns (bytes memory) {\n    return abi.encode(token, receivers);\n}\n```\n:::\n\nOnce, you set up and tested your Macro contract, you can deploy it to your target EVM network and use the `MacroForwarder` contract to batch call the transactions.\n\n### 3. Use the Macro Forwarder to batch call the transactions\n\nThe `MacroForwarder` contract is used to batch call the transactions. It is a simple contract that has a method called `runMacro` which takes the following parameters:\n\n- `IUserDefinedMacro m`: The address of the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface\n- `bytes calldata params`: The parameters of the macro\n\nThe `runMacro` method is called by the user and it will batch call the transactions defined in the `buildBatchOperations` method of the `IUserDefinedMacro` contract.\n\nTo showcase how this works, we use the [`MacroFowarder` contract](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xFD0268E33111565dE546af2675351A4b1587F89F) deployed on OP Sepolia.\nWe deployed an example of our [`MultiFlowDeleteMacro` contract](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x997b37Fb47c489CF067421aEeAf7Be0543fA5362) on the same network.\nWe will use the `MacroForwarder` contract to batch call the transactions.\n\nWe showcase below a simple React component which implements all of this:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the `MacroForwarderComponent`</summary>\n<p>\n\n```jsx\nconst MacroForwarderComponent = ({\n  macroForwarderAddress,\n  userDefinedMacroAddress,\n}) => {\n  const [walletAddress, setWalletAddress] = useState("");\n  const [superToken, setSuperToken] = useState("");\n  const [receivers, setReceivers] = useState("");\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");\n\n  // ABI for MacroForwarder contract including `runMacro`\n  const macroForwarderABI = [\n    //ABI for MacroForwarder contract\n  ];\n\n  // ABI for your UserDefinedMacro including `getParams`\n  const iUserDefinedMacroABI = [\n    //ABI for your UserDefinedMacro including `getParams`\n  ];\n\n  const connectWallet = async () => {\n    if (window.ethereum) {\n      try {\n        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n        await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);\n        const signer = provider.getSigner();\n        const address = await signer.getAddress();\n        setWalletAddress(address);\n        console.log("Connected to MetaMask");\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error("Error connecting to MetaMask", error);\n        setMessage("Error connecting to MetaMask");\n      }\n    } else {\n      console.log("Ethereum wallet is not connected or not installed.");\n      setMessage("Ethereum wallet is not connected or not installed.");\n    }\n  };\n\n  const executeMacro = async () => {\n    try {\n      if (!walletAddress) throw new Error("Wallet not connected.");\n      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n      const signer = provider.getSigner();\n\n      const userDefinedMacroContract = new ethers.Contract(\n        userDefinedMacroAddress,\n        iUserDefinedMacroABI,\n        signer\n      );\n      const receiversArray = receivers\n        .split(",")\n        .map((address) => address.trim());\n      const params = await userDefinedMacroContract.getParams(\n        superToken,\n        receiversArray\n      );\n\n      const macroForwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(\n        macroForwarderAddress,\n        macroForwarderABI,\n        signer\n      );\n      const tx = await macroForwarderContract.runMacro(\n        userDefinedMacroAddress,\n        params\n      );\n      await tx.wait();\n      setMessage("Macro executed successfully.");\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error("Error executing macro", error);\n      setMessage(`Error: ${error.message}`);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        textAlign: "center",\n        padding: "20px",\n        fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif",\n      }}\n    >\n      <h2>Macro Forwarder Interface</h2>\n      <h3>Connect Wallet to your chosen testnet (e.g. OP Sepolia)</h3>\n      {walletAddress ?

We will specifically show how you can connect members to pools, and claim tokens from them.\n\n## Interacting with the Superfluid Protocol\n\nTo interact with Superfluid's distribution pools from client applications, you'll use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract. Here's how to set it up:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nThe `GDAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all Superfluid chains:\n\n```\n0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08\n```\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract in the [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n\n### Setting up with ethers.js\n\nHere's how to initiate interaction with the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the GDAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n\n// The ABI of the GDAv1Forwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSigner());\n```\n\n## Understanding Connecting and Claiming\n\nWhen interacting with Superfluid pools, it's important to understand the difference between connecting to a pool and claiming from it:\n\n1. **Connecting to a Pool**: \n   - When a member connects to a pool, they start receiving streams and transfers in real-time.\n   - The member's balance will automatically reflect incoming tokens without any further action.\n   - This is ideal for continuous, real-time token distribution.\n\n2. **Claiming from a Pool**:\n   - Claiming is the process of explicitly withdrawing accumulated tokens from the pool.\n   - Members can claim periodically to move tokens from the pool to their personal balance.\n   - This is useful for members who prefer to manually manage their token receipts or for specific accounting purposes.\n\nIn essence, connecting provides a passive, continuous flow of tokens, while claiming is an active process to withdraw accumulated tokens.\n\n## Interacting with the GDAv1Forwarder Contract\n\nLet's look at how to use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract to connect, disconnect, and claim from pools.\n\n### Connecting to a Pool\n\nTo connect a member to a pool, use the `connectPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction connectPool(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to connect.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst connectPool = async (poolAddress, userData = \"0x\") => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.connectPool(poolAddress, userData);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Successfully connected to pool\");\n    return receipt.status === 1; // 1 indicates success\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error connecting to pool:\", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n:::tip Connecting triggers a claim\nWhen a member connects to a pool, the contract automatically claims all the previously available tokens for the member.\n:::\n\n### Disconnecting from a Pool\n\nTo disconnect a member from a pool, use the `disconnectPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction disconnectPool(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to disconnect.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst disconnectPool = async (poolAddress, userData = \"0x\") => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.disconnectPool(poolAddress, userData);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Successfully disconnected from pool\");\n    return receipt.status === 1; // 1 indicates success\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error disconnecting from pool:\", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Claiming All Tokens from a Pool\n\nTo claim all available tokens for a member from a pool, use the `claimAll` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to claim from.\n- `memberAddress`: The address of the member to claim for.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst claimAll = async (poolAddress, memberAddress, userData = \"0x\") => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.claimAll(poolAddress, memberAddress, userData);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Successfully claimed all tokens from pool\");\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error claiming tokens from pool:\", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Pool Interaction\n\nHere's an example of a UI component for connecting, disconnecting, and claiming from Superfluid pools:\n\n```jsx live\n\nfunction PoolInteractionManager() {\n  const [poolAddress, setPoolAddress] = useState('');\n  const [memberAddress, setMemberAddress] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n\n  const forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n  const forwarderABI = GDAv1ForwarderABI;

Here's how to set it up:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nThe `GDAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all Superfluid chains:\n\n```\n0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08\n```\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract in the [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n\n### Setting up with ethers.js\n\nHere's how to initiate interaction with the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the GDAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n\n// The ABI of the GDAv1Forwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSigner());\n```\n\n## Understanding Distribution Pools\n\nDistributions is a Superfluid primitive that allows scalable one-to-many or many-to-many transfer of value, in the form of discrete transfers or Money Streaming. Superfluid's implementation of this concept allows for the creation of **Pools** with a designated **pool admin** who manages **units** for **pool members**.\n\nKey concepts:\n- **Pool**: A mechanism for distributing tokens among multiple recipients.\n- **Pool Admin**: The address that has control over the pool's configuration and member units.\n- **Units**: A measure of a member's share in the pool's distributions.\n- **Pool Members**: Addresses that receive distributions from the pool based on their units.\n\n## Interacting with the GDAv1Forwarder Contract\n\nLet's look at how to use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract to create and manage distribution pools.\n\n### Creating a Pool\n\nTo create a new Superfluid Pool, use the `createPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(\n    ISuperfluidToken token,\n    address admin,\n    PoolConfig memory config\n) external returns (bool success, ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address.\n- `admin`: The pool admin address.\n- `config`: The pool configuration (see below).\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n:::warning Strong recommendation\nWe don't recommend setting `transferabilityForUnitsOwner` to `true` unless you have a specific use case that absolutely requires it. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.\n:::\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst createPool = async (tokenAddress, adminAddress, config) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.createPool(tokenAddress, adminAddress, config);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    const [success, poolAddress] = receipt.events.find(e => e.event === 'PoolCreated').args;\n    console.log(\"Pool created successfully:\", poolAddress);\n    return poolAddress;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error creating pool:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Updating Member Units\n\nTo update the units of a pool member, use the `updateMemberUnits` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateMemberUnits(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress,\n    uint128 newUnits,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to update.\n- `memberAddress`: The address of the member to update.\n- `newUnits`: The new units of the member.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst updateMemberUnits = async (poolAddress, memberAddress, newUnits, userData) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.updateMemberUnits(poolAddress, memberAddress, newUnits, userData);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Member units updated successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error updating member units:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Distribution Pool Management\n\nHere's an example of a UI component for creating and managing distribution pools:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction DistributionPoolManager() {\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [adminAddress, setAdminAddress] = useState('');\n  const [poolAddress, setPoolAddress] = useState('');\n  const [memberAddress, setMemberAddress] = useState('');\n  const [newUnits, setNewUnits] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n\n  const forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n  const forwarderABI = GDAv1ForwarderABI; // You will need to import the ABI in your code.

Each event entity is immutable and created once.\n\n- **Event ID Format**: `eventName-transactionHash-logIndex`.\n- **Naming Convention**: For V1, event names end with 'Event'.\n\n### Higher Order Level Entities (HOL)\n\nHOL entities represent entities over their lifetime and may be updated.\n\n- **`Account`**: Represents any address interacting with Superfluid.\n- **`Token`**: Represents valid SuperTokens.\n- **`Pool`**, **`PoolMember`**, **`Stream`**, **`StreamPeriod`**: Related to Superfluid streams and [pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx).\n\n### Aggregate Entities\n\nAggregate entities store cumulative data at both account-token and global token levels:\n\n- **`TokenStatistic`**: Aggregates data for a single Token type.\n- **`AccountTokenSnapshot`**: Aggregates data on an account's interaction with a token.\n\n## Query Examples\n\n### Super Token Data Query\n\n```javascript\n{\n  tokens(first: 100) {\n    id\n    symbol\n    name\n    underlyingAddress\n  }\n}\n```\n### Get the pools that a user is a member of\n\nTo list all pools that an account is currently a member (insert the ethereum address in the query below):\n\n```javascript\nquery MyQuery {\n  pools(\n    first: 10\n    where: {poolMembers_: {account: \"YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE\", account_: {}}}\n  ) {\n    totalUnits\n    totalMembers\n    flowRate\n    createdAtBlockNumber\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Get all the pools for a specific token\n\nTo list all pools for a token (insert the token address in the query below):\n\n```javascript\nquery MyQuery {\n  pools(where: {token: \"YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS_HERE\"}) {\n    createdAtBlockNumber\n    createdAtTimestamp\n    flowRate\n    id\n    totalMembers\n    totalUnits\n    admin {\n      isSuperApp\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Get all the pools for a specific pool admin\n\nTo list all pools for a pool admin (insert the pool admin address in the query below):\n\n```javascript\nquery MyQuery {\n  pools(first: 10, where: {admin: \"YOUR_POOL_ADMIN_ADDRESS_HERE\"}) {\n    totalUnits\n    totalMembers\n    flowRate\n    createdAtBlockNumber\n    token {\n      id\n      isSuperToken\n      symbol\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Explore more queries\n\nExplore more queries using the [Superfluid Subgraph Playground](https://console.superfluid.finance/subgraph).\n",

Create a new Next.js project:\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest rewards-distribution --typescript --tailwind\ncd rewards-distribution\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install ethers@6 @superfluid-finance/sdk-core\n```\n\n3. Install UI components:\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest init\n```\n\n## Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n### Superfluid Distribution Pools\n\n[Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview) allow for proportional distribution of streaming tokens. Think of it as a smart contract that:\n- Manages a pool of tokens\n- Distributes streams based on units assigned to recipients\n- Handles all the complex token streaming logic\n\n:::tip\nTo deploy a Distribution Pool, you can use the [GDAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n### Superfluid Macros\n\n[Macros](/docs/sdk/advanced-topics/batch-calls) allow us to batch multiple operations into a single transaction. In our case, we're using:\n- `MacroForwarder`: Contract that executes our macro\n- [`RewardsMacro`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/rewards-macro-example/blob/main/contracts/RewardsMacro.sol): Our custom macro for setting up distributions\n\nIn our example, we deployed a [`RewardsMacro`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/rewards-macro-example/blob/main/contracts/RewardsMacro.sol) contract on [OP Sepolia](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xA315e7EB0a278fac7B3a74DB895f5bf801EAb632?tab=contract) for the purposes of our example.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Network Management\n\nFirst, we need to ensure users are on the correct network:\n\n```typescript\nconst OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID = \"0xaa37dc\" // 11155420 in hex\n\nconst switchToOpSepolia = async () => {\n  try {\n    await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',\n      params: [{ chainId: OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID }],\n    });\n    return true;\n  } catch (switchError) {\n    // Handle network switch error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Pool Validation\n\nWe validate the pool address and check user's balance:\n\n```typescript\nconst POOL_ABI = [\"function superToken() external view returns (ISuperfluidToken)\"]\nconst SUPER_TOKEN_ABI = [\"function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)\"]\n\nconst checkPoolAndBalance = async () => {\n  const poolContract = new ethers.Contract(poolAddress, POOL_ABI, provider);\n  const tokenAddress = await poolContract.superToken();\n  const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, SUPER_TOKEN_ABI, provider);\n  const balance = await tokenContract.balanceOf(userAddress);\n  // Handle results\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Reward Distribution Setup\n\nThe core functionality uses the RewardsMacro contract:\n\n```typescript\nconst executeRewardsMacro = async () => {\n  // Parse recipients and units\n  const receivers = [...] // Array of addresses\n  const units = [...] // Array of BigInts\n  \n  // Convert flow rate from tokens/day to wei/second\n  const weiBigInt = ethers.parseEther(flowRatePerDay)\n  const flowRateWeiPerSecond = weiBigInt / BigInt(86400)\n  \n  // Get macro parameters\n  const params = await rewardsMacro.getParams(\n    poolAddress,\n    receivers,\n    units,\n    flowRateWeiPerSecond\n  )\n  \n  // Execute through MacroForwarder\n  await macroForwarder.runMacro(REWARDS_MACRO, params)\n}\n```\n\n## User Interface\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/img/example-ui.png\" alt=\"Example UI\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Screenshot of the UI*</p>\n</div>\n\nThe UI is built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. Key features include:\n- Network status indicator\n- Pool validation feedback\n- Balance display\n- Recipients input area\n- Flow rate input with conversion\n\n```typescript\n<Card className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto bg-gray-800\">\n  <CardHeader>\n    <CardTitle>Reward Stream Distribution</CardTitle>\n  </CardHeader>\n  <CardContent>\n    {/* Network Check */}\n    {/* Pool Input */}\n    {/* Recipients Input */}\n    {/* Flow Rate Input */}\n    {/* Execute Button */}\n  </CardContent>\n</Card>\n```\n\n## Testing the Application\n\n1. Deploy the contract and set up your pool\n   - Deploy the `RewardsMacro` contract on your desired network (you can use the contract deployed on [OP Sepolia](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xA315e7EB0a278fac7B3a74DB895f5bf801EAb632?tab=contract))\n   - Create your pool using the [GDAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder)\n   - Ensure you use the correct Super Token for your pool (in our example, we used the [Super fake DAI](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0x7f5c765057ef45c28ae624f7b77854c32c201422?tab=contract) Super Token)\n\n2. Test the flow:\n   - Connect wallet\n   - Enter pool address\n   - Add recipients\n   - Set flow rate\n   - Execute distribution\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### Invalid Pool Address\n```typescript\ntry {\n  await poolContract.superToken()\n} catch (e) {\n  // Handle invalid pool\n}\n```\n\n### Insufficient Balance\n```typescript\nif (Number(userBalance) === 0) {\n  // Disable execution\n  // Show warning\n}\n```\n\n### Network Issues\n```typescript\nif (chainId !== OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID) {\n  await switchToOpSepolia()\n}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nConsider extending the application with:\n- Multiple network support\n- Distribution history\n- Analytics dashboard",

This is particularly useful for automated systems, multi-sig wallets, or any scenario where you want to delegate flow management.\n\nKey concepts:\n- **Flow Operator**: An account that has been granted permissions to manage flows on behalf of another account.\n- **Permissions**: The specific actions a flow operator is allowed to perform (create, update, delete flows).\n- **Flow Rate Allowance**: The maximum net flow rate a flow operator can create on behalf of the account.\n\n## User Data in Superfluid\n\nUser data in Superfluid allows you to attach additional information to transactions. This can be used for various purposes:\n- Including metadata with transactions\n- Triggering specific logic in receiver contracts\n- Implementing off-chain systems that react to on-chain events\n\nUser data is typically passed as a `bytes` parameter in Superfluid functions, allowing you to encode any type of data you need.\n\n## Key Functions for Access Control (with User Data)\n\n### grantPermissions\n\nGrants permissions to a flow operator to manage flows on behalf of the caller.\n\n```solidity\nfunction grantPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `flowOperator`: The account to which permissions are granted\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst grantPermissions = async (tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.grantPermissions(tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Permissions granted successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error granting permissions:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### revokePermissions\n\nRevokes all permissions previously granted to a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction revokePermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `flowOperator`: The account from which permissions are revoked\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst revokePermissions = async (tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.revokePermissions(tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Permissions revoked successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error revoking permissions:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### setFlowrateFrom\n\nAllows a flow operator to set the flow rate from one account to another.\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowrateFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `sender`: The sender of the flow\n- `receiver`: The receiver of the flow\n- `flowrate`: The desired flow rate in tokens per second (using 18 decimal places)\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst setFlowrateFrom = async (tokenAddress, senderAddress, receiverAddress, flowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.setFlowrateFrom(tokenAddress, senderAddress, receiverAddress, flowRate);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Flow rate set successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error setting flow rate:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Access Control List Management\n\nHere's an example of a UI component for managing access control lists:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction AccessControlManager() {\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [flowOperator, setFlowOperator] = useState('');\n  const [sender, setSender] = useState('');\n  const [receiver, setReceiver] = useState('');\n  const [flowRate, setFlowRate] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n  \n  const forwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n  const forwarderABI = CFAv1ForwarderABI; // You will need to import the ABI in your code. You can do that from: https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder\n\n\n  const connectWallet = async () => {\n    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n      try {\n        await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });\n        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n        const signer = provider.getSigner();\n        const address = await signer.getAddress();\n        setAccount(address);\n        setWalletConnected(true);\n        toast({\n          title: 'Wallet connected',\n          description: `Connected to ${address}`,\n          status: 'success',\n          duration: 3000,\n          isClosable: true,\n        });\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to connect wallet:', error);\n        toast({\n          title: 'Connection failed',\n          description: 'Failed to connect wallet.

Here's how to get started:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract in the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n\nThe `CFAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all networks:\n\n```\n0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125\n```\n\n### Initiating Contract Interaction with ethers.js\n\nHere's an example of how to initiate interaction with the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the CFAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n\n// The ABI of the CFAv1Forwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSigner());\n```\n\nNow that we have our contract instance set up, let's look at how to create, update, and delete flows.\n\n## Creating a Flow\n\nTo create a new flow, you can use the `createFlow` function of the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction createFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `token`: The address of the Super Token you want to stream.\n- `sender`: The address that will be sending the tokens.\n- `receiver`: The address that will be receiving the tokens.\n- `flowrate`: The rate at which tokens will be streamed, in tokens per second (using 18 decimal places).\n- `userData`: (Optional) Additional data to include with the transaction. Use \"0x\" if not needed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst createFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver, flowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.createFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      flowRate,\n      \"0x\" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Flow created successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error creating flow:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n:::tip using setFlowrate instead\nYou can also use the `setFlowrate` function to update the flow rate of an existing flow.\nFor a full list of functions available in the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n## Updating a Flow\n\nTo update an existing flow, use the `updateFlow` function.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe parameters are the same as for `createFlow`. The `flowrate` parameter specifies the new flow rate.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst updateFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver, newFlowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.updateFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      newFlowRate,\n      \"0x\" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Flow updated successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error updating flow:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n:::tip using setFlowrate instead\nYou can also use the `setFlowrate` function to update the flow rate of an existing flow.\nFor a full list of functions available in the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n## Deleting a Flow\n\nTo stop and delete an existing flow, use the `deleteFlow` function.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction deleteFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `token`: The address of the Super Token of the flow you want to delete.\n- `sender`: The address that is sending the tokens in the flow.\n- `receiver`: The address that is receiving the tokens in the flow.\n- `userData`: (Optional) Additional data to include with the transaction. Use \"0x\" if not needed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst deleteFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.deleteFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      \"0x\" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Flow deleted successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error deleting flow:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n:::tip using setFlowrate instead\nYou can also use the `setFlowrate` function to update the flow rate of an existing flow.\nFor a full list of functions available in the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n\n## Building a Simple UI\n\nHere's an example of how you might build a simple UI to interact with these functions:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction FlowManager() {\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [receiver, setReceiver] = useState('');\n  const [flowRate, setFlowRate] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n\n  const forwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n  const forwarderABI = CFAv1ForwarderABI; // You will need to import the ABI in your code.

Think of entities as analogous to database tables. Here's a brief overview:\n\n### Event Entities\n\nEvent entities correspond to contract events, often with added data. Each event entity is immutable and created once.\n\n- **Event ID Format**: `eventName-transactionHash-logIndex`.\n- **Naming Convention**: For V1, event names end with 'Event'.\n\n### Higher Order Level Entities (HOL)\n\nHOL entities represent entities over their lifetime and may be updated.\n\n- **`Account`**: Represents any address interacting with Superfluid.\n- **`Token`**: Represents valid SuperTokens.\n- **`Pool`**, **`PoolMember`**, **`Stream`**, **`StreamPeriod`**: Related to Superfluid streams and [pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools).\n\n### Aggregate Entities\n\nAggregate entities store cumulative data at both account-token and global token levels:\n\n- **`TokenStatistic`**: Aggregates data for a single Token type.\n- **`AccountTokenSnapshot`**: Aggregates data on an account's interaction with a token.\n\n## Query Examples\n\nHere are examples to help you get started with Superfluid subgraphs:\n\n### Super Token Data Query\n\n```javascript\n{\n  tokens(first: 100) {\n    id\n    symbol\n    name\n    underlyingAddress\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Get All Streams for a Given Account\n\nTo list all streams that an account is currently receiving (swap 'receiver' for 'sender' to see streams being sent):\n\n```javascript\nquery MyQuery {\n  streams(where: {receiver: \"YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE\"}) {\n    currentFlowRate\n    token {\n      symbol\n    }\n    sender {\n      id\n    }\n    receiver {\n      id\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Getting Stream Data Between 2 Parties\n\nQuery active streams between two parties, such as Alice (\"0x658...\") and Bob (\"0xd66...\"):\n\n```javascript\n{\n  streams(where:{\n    sender: \"0x658e1b019f2f30c8089a9ae3ae5820f335bd9ce4\"\n    receiver: \"0xd66e40b0c30595bec72153b502ac1e0c4785991b\"\n  }) {\n    token {\n      id\n      symbol\n    }\n    createdAtTimestamp\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n    currentFlowRate\n    streamedUntilUpdatedAt\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n\nTo calculate the current total amount streamed, use: _**streamedUntilUpdatedAt + ((current time in seconds) - updatedAtTimestamp) * currentFlowRate**_.\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Get The Most Recently Updated Flows\n\nQuery the 10 most recently updated flows using the `FlowUpdatedEvent` type:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  flowUpdatedEvents(first: 10, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {\n    oldFlowRate\n    flowRate\n    userData\n    stream {\n      token {\n        symbol\n      }\n      sender {\n        id\n      }\n      receiver {\n        id\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"info\">\n\nUnderstand the difference between a Flow and a Stream. A new stream is created each time a stream is terminated and restarted.\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Get Aggregate Flow Data For a Given Token\n\nQuery aggregate data for a specific token, such as Super DAI on Polygon:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  tokenStatistics(where: {\n    id: \"0x1305f6b6df9dc47159d12eb7ac2804d4a33173c2\" // DAIx address on Matic\n  }) {\n    totalNumberOfActiveStreams\n    totalNumberOfActiveIndexes\n    totalAmountStreamedUntilUpdatedAt\n    totalOutflowRate\n    totalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Get Data On a Specific Account\n\nQuery data on a specific account using both the `Account` and `AccountTokenSnapshot` entities:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  accounts(where: {\n    id: \"0x...\" // Enter an address below\n  }) {\n    isSuperApp\n    inflows {\n      currentFlowRate\n      token {\n        symbol\n      }\n      sender {\n        id\n      }\n    }\n    outflows {\n      currentFlowRate\n      token {\n        symbol\n      }\n      receiver {\n        id\n      }\n    }\n    accountTokenSnapshots {\n      token {\n        id\n      }\n      totalNumberOfActiveStreams\n      totalNetFlowRate\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\">\n\nUse `AccountTokenSnapshot` to get activity data for a specific token associated with an account.\n\n</Admonition> \n\n## Explore more queries\n\nExplore more queries using the [Superfluid Subgraph Playground](https://console.superfluid.finance/subgraph).",
      "---\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\n# Quickstart\n\nThis guide will help you get started with the Superfluid protocol by creating a simple React app that interacts with the protocol.\nYou'll learn how to connect your wallet, create streams, and create pools using the Superfluid protocol.\n\n## How to Interact with the Superfluid Protocol\n\nWhen interacting with the Superfluid protocol from a client application, you'll use one of two contracts depending on the functionality you need:\n\n1. For Money Streaming: Use the [`CFAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) contract\n2. For Distribution Pools: Use the [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder) contract\n\nWe use these forwarder contracts instead of building an SDK because:\n- It simplifies the integration process\n- It reduces the need for frequent updates to the SDK\n- It allows for more flexibility and direct interaction with the protocol\n\n## Contract Addresses and ABIs\n\nHere are the addresses for each contract across all Superfluid-supported chains:\n\n- `CFAv1Forwarder`: `0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125`\n- `GDAv1Forwarder`: `0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08`\n\nYou can find the full ABIs for these contracts in the following technical references:\n- [CFAv1Forwarder ABI](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder)\n- [GDAv1Forwarder ABI](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder)\n\n## Creating a React App (Next.js)\n\nTo create a new Next.js app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your terminal and run:\n   ```\n   npx create-next-app@latest my-superfluid-app\n   ```\n2. Navigate to your new app directory:\n   ```\n   cd my-superfluid-app\n   ```\n3. Install necessary dependencies:\n   ```\n   npm install ethers@5.7.2\n   ```\n\n## Superfluid Interaction Component\n\nIn this section, we will provide a React component that allows you to interact with the Superfluid protocol.\nThis component will allow you to:\n- Connect your wallet (eg. Metamask)\n- Create a stream through the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract (for [Money Streaming](docs/concepts/overview/money-streaming))\n- Create a pool through the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract (for [Distribution Pools](docs/concepts/overview/distributions))\n\nHere's a React component that allows you to create a stream and create a pool. You can copy and paste this into a new file in your Next.js app's `pages` directory (e.g., `pages/superfluid-demo.js`):\n\n:::note\nFor a full list of available functions and events, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) and [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n```jsx live\n// Don't forget imports\n//import React, { useState } from 'react';\n//import { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\nfunction SuperfluidDemo() {\n  const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [receiverAddress, setReceiverAddress] = useState('');\n  const [flowRate, setFlowRate] = useState('');\n  const [adminAddress, setAdminAddress] = useState('');\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  const CFAv1ForwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n  const GDAv1ForwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n  // Simplified ABIs with only the functions we need\n  const CFAv1ForwarderABI = [\n  \"function createFlow(address token, address sender, address receiver, int96 flowRate, bytes memory userData) external returns (bool)\"\n  ];\n\n  const GDAv1ForwarderABI = [\n  \"function createPool(address token, address admin, (uint32 transferabilityForUnitsOwner, bool distributionFromAnyAddress) memory poolConfig) external returns (bool, address)\"\n  ];\n\n  const connectWallet = async () => {\n    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n      try {\n        await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });\n        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n        setProvider(provider);\n        const signer = provider.getSigner();\n        const address = await signer.getAddress();\n        setAccount(address);\n        setMessage(`Connected to ${address}`);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to connect wallet:', error);\n        setMessage('Failed to connect wallet.

Copy the above code into a new file in your Next.js app's `pages` directory (e.g., `pages/superfluid-demo.js`).\n2. Uncomment the necessary imports at the top of the file.\n3. Run your Next.js app with `npm run dev`.\n4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/superfluid-demo` in your browser.\n5. Connect your wallet, then you can create streams and pools using the Superfluid protocol.\n\nThis component provides a basic interface for creating streams and pools. In a production environment, you would want to add more error checking, input validation, and additional features.\n\n:::tip About the Component\nA few tips in order to make sure you can use the component correctly:\n- The component above uses simple ethers.js functions to interact with the Superfluid protocol. You can choose to use a different library or SDK if you prefer (eg. [Viem](https://viem.sh/), [Web3.js](https://docs.web3js.org/)).\n- The component does not manage wallet connections or chain switching in a production-ready way. You should add more robust error handling and user feedback.\n- The component uses the Superfluid forwarders ABIs in a simplified form. You can find the full ABIs in the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) and [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::",

It\'s used to throttle the animation and ensure that updates occur no more frequently than every 40 milliseconds.\n\n## Utility Functions\n\n### `absoluteValue`\n\n```jsx\nexport const absoluteValue = (n: bigint) => {\n  return n >= BigInt(0) ? n : -n;\n};\n```\n\nConverts a `bigint` to its absolute value. This function is crucial for calculations that require the non-negative form of a number.\n\n### `toFixedUsingString`\n\n```jsx\nexport function toFixedUsingString(numStr: string, decimalPlaces: number): string {\n  // Implementation details\n}\n```\n\nFormats a number (expressed as a string) to a specified number of decimal places. This function is essential for displaying the balance in a user-friendly format, ensuring that the balance is rounded and displayed with a consistent number of decimal places.\n\n## Hooks\n\n### `useSignificantFlowingDecimal`\n\n```jsx\nexport const useSignificantFlowingDecimal = (flowRate: bigint, animationStepTimeInMs: number): number | undefined => {\n  // Hook logic\n};\n```\n\nDetermines the number of significant decimal places to display based on the flow rate and animation step time. This custom hook helps adjust the precision of the balance display dynamically, based on how quickly the balance is changing.\n\n### `useFlowingBalance`\n\n```jsx\nconst useFlowingBalance = (startingBalance: bigint, startingBalanceDate: Date, flowRate: bigint) => {\n  // Hook logic\n};\n```\n\nCalculates and updates the flowing balance over time. This hook is the core of the component, using the `requestAnimationFrame` API to smoothly update the balance display at a rate that\'s throttled by `ANIMATION_MINIMUM_STEP_TIME`.\n\n## FlowingBalance Component\n\n```jsx\nconst FlowingBalance: React.FC<{startingBalance: bigint; startingBalanceDate: Date; flowRate: bigint;}> = memo(({ startingBalance, startingBalanceDate, flowRate }) => {\n  // Component logic\n});\n```\n\nThis functional component uses the above hooks and utility functions to render the flowing balance. It takes `startingBalance`, `startingBalanceDate`, and `flowRate` as props, calculating the current balance based on these inputs and displaying it in a formatted manner.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nBelow is an example of how to use the `FlowingBalance` component within your application.\n\n```jsx\n<FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n```\n\nThis component exemplifies how to combine React\'s capabilities with the performance of the Web APIs to create dynamic and responsive UIs. By breaking down the component into its constituent parts, developers can gain insights into its functionality and customize it according to their needs.\n\n:::tip My component is being jumpy, what can I do?\nSometimes, especially if you center your component using `justifyContent: "center"`, the component may have a jumpy behaviour like below:\n<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n    ❌ <FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n</div>\nIf you run into this issue, you can try to set a fixed width to the component like such:\n```jsx\n<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <div style={{ width: "135px", margin: "auto" }}>\n    <FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\nThis should fix the jumpy behaviour and make the component flow smoothly like the example below:\n<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <div style={{ width: "160px", margin: "auto" }}>\n   ✅ <FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n  </div>\n</div>\n:::\n\n## Best practices\n\n- **Throttle the animation**: Ensure that the animation updates occur at a reasonable interval, such as every 40 milliseconds. This helps prevent excessive CPU usage and ensures a smooth user experience.\n- **Use fixed width**: If the component is jumpy, consider setting a fixed width to the component to ensure a smooth flow of the balance.\n- **Time conversion**: When showing the flow rate and converting the blockchain value to a human-readable value (eg. wei/s to ETH/month),\n    ensure that the time conversion is accurate and consistent with the rest of Superfluid\'s time-based calculations:\n    - 1 year = 365 days\n    - 1 month = 1 year/12\n    - 1 day = 24 hours\n    - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n    - 1 minute = 60 seconds\n    - 1 second = 1000 milliseconds\n- **Current timestamp**: Following Superfluid\'s implementation, it is recommended to use `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp in milliseconds instead of using `(await ethers.provider.getBlock(\'latest\')).timestamp` for example.\n',

You can view balances in Metamask, transfer funds using Gnosis Safe, and even swap Super Tokens on platforms like Uniswap.\n- **Forward Compatibility**: While tools like Metamask and Gnosis Safe can display balances accurately, they do not support all functionalities of Super Tokens. For example, you cannot swap your streamed money on Automated Market Makers (eg. Uniswap).\n\n## Balance Tracking Considerations\n\nTracking the balance of Super Tokens requires a more nuanced approach than traditional ERC20 tokens.\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Event-Based Tracking Limitation**: Some applications, like Etherscan, use `transfer` events to track user balances. However, due to scalability concerns, Super Tokens don\'t emit `transfer` events with every balance change, leading to potential discrepancies in displayed balances.\n- **Multi-source updates**: Super Tokens can be updated from multiple sources, from [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx), but also [Distributions](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview.mdx).\n\n### Solution 1 (recommended): Using `balanceOf`\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Super Tokens are ERC20 compatible, so you can use the `balanceOf` function from the token smart contract to get the real time aggregated balance of a user.\nThe Superfluid Protocol modifies the `balanceOf` function to account for the various fund movement methods unique to Super Tokens including Money Streaming and Distributions.\nYou can simply call this function to get the real time aggregated balance of a user like so:\n\n```jsx\nconst fetchBlockchainBalance = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    setError("");\n    try {\n      const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n        "YOUR PROVIDER URL"\n      );\n      const contractAddress = "0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f"; //fake DAIx contract address on Mumbai\n      const contractABI = [\n        "function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint value)",\n        "function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint balance)",\n      ];\n      const contract = new ethers.Contract(\n        contractAddress,\n        contractABI,\n        provider\n      );\n      const userAddress = liveAddress;\n      const balance = await contract.balanceOf(userAddress);\n      return(ethers.utils.formatEther(balance.toString()));\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error("Error fetching blockchain balance:", error);\n    }\n  };\n```\n\n:::tip About Accuracy\nWe recommend this solution because it guarantees the most accurate result. However, it is important to note that this method is not always possible depending on your application architecture design.\n:::\n\n### Solution 2: Using queries from the Subgraph\n\nTo accurately track Super Token balances, you can use the queries below to get inflows and outflow object from Superfluid\'s [Subgraph](https://explorer.superfluid.finance/subgraph).\n\n#### Getting all the inflows for user\n```graphql\nquery allReceivedStreams($receiver: String) {\n  cfaStreams: streams(where: {receiver: $receiver}) {\n    currentFlowRate\n    streamedUntilUpdatedAt\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n  }\n  gdaStreams: poolMembers(where: {account: $receiver}) {\n    pool {\n      totalUnits\n      flowRate\n      totalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n      updatedAtTimestamp\n    }\n    units\n    totalAmountReceivedUntilUpdatedAt\n    poolTotalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Getting all the outflows for user\n```graphql\nquery allSentStreams($sender: String) {\n  cfaStreams: streams(where: {sender: $sender}) {\n    currentFlowRate\n    streamedUntilUpdatedAt\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n  }\n  gdaStreams: poolDistributors(where: {account: $sender}) {\n    flowRate\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n    totalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n  }\n}\n```\nDoing this allows you to do the following:\n- Get **the data related to each stream a user is receiving** : This allows us to calculate the positive balance associated with each stream they receive.\n- Get **the data related to each pool where the user is connected** : This allows us to calculate the positive balance associated with each membership in a pool.\n- Get **the data related to each stream a user is sending** : This allows us to calculate the negative balance associated with each stream they send.\n- Get **the data related to each pool where the user is distributing** : This allows us to calculate the negative balance associated with each distribution they make.\n\n:::tip How to calculate each balance?\nThe rule of thumb for calculating each one of these balances is the following:\n\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\' }}>\n    **The Balance = FlowRate * (CurrentTime - LastUpdatedAtTime) + StreamedUntilUpdatedAt**.\n</div>\n:::\n\n\nOnce we have the balance from each stream and each pool/distribution, we can sum them up to get the net aggregated balance of a user.\nAn implementation of this can be seen in the `NetBalance` component below.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `NetBalance` component</summary>\n<p>\n```jsx\nconst NetBalance = ({ liveAddress }) => {\n  const [realTimeBalance, setRealTimeBalance] = useState(null);\n  const [blockchainBalance, setBlockchainBalance] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n  const [error, setError] = useState("");\n\n  async function fetchSubgraphBalance() {\n    setLoading(true);

It allows users to convert their ERC20 tokens to Super Tokens and vice versa.\n\n:::tip how to deploy a wrapped super token?\nIf you need to deploy a Wrapped Super Token, you can follow our guide on [Deploying a Wrapped Super Token](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-wrapped-super-token).\n:::\n\n\n## Why do we need to wrap and unwrap Super Tokens?\n\nSuper Tokens are an enhanced version of ERC20 tokens, typically built on top of existing ERC20 tokens. This means that to use a Super Token, you often need to \"wrap\" an ERC20 token into its Super Token equivalent, and vice versa when you want to convert back to the original ERC20.\n\nTo find out the address of the underlying ERC20 token for a Super Token, you can use the `getUnderlyingToken` view function provided by the [Super Token interface contract](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperToken.sol).\n\n:::tip Super Token Interface\nYou can find the complete Super Token interface in our [ISuperToken Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken).\n:::\n\n:::warning Not all Wrapped Super Tokens have an underlying ERC20 token\nIn the case of [Native Super Tokens](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/overview#3-native-super-tokens) (like the ETHx), they do not have a underlying ERC20 token, but rather the native coin of the chain.\nNative Super Tokens inherit the ISETH interface, which you can also find in the [Technical Reference Section](/docs/technical-reference/ISETH).\n:::\n\n## Super Token ABI\n\nYou can find the ABI for the Super Token Interface at the [ISuperToken Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken). This ABI includes all the functions available for interacting with Super Tokens.\n\nYou can find the ABI for the Native Super Token Interface at the [ISETH Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/ISETH). This ABI includes all the functions available for interacting with Native Super Tokens.\n\n## Wrapping and Unwrapping Functions\n\nSuper Tokens provide several functions for wrapping (upgrading) and unwrapping (downgrading) tokens:\n\n### Wrapping (Upgrading) Functions\n\nFor wrapping ERC20 tokens into Super Tokens, you can use the following functions from the [Super Token interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken):\n1. `upgrade(uint256 amount)`: Upgrades ERC20 tokens to Super Tokens.\n2. `upgradeTo(address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData)`: Upgrades ERC20 tokens to Super Tokens and transfers them to a specified address.\n\nFor wrapping Native Super Tokens (like ETHx), you can use the following function from the [ISETH interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISETH):\n1. `upgradeByETH() payable`: Upgrades native tokens to Super Tokens.\n2. `upgradeByETHTo(address to) payable`: Upgrades native tokens to Super Tokens and transfers them to a specified address.\n\n### Unwrapping (Downgrading) Functions\n\nFor unwrapping Super Tokens back to ERC20 tokens, you can use the following functions from the [Super Token interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken):\n1. `downgrade(uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens back to ERC20 tokens.\n2. `downgradeTo(address to, uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens to ERC20 tokens and transfers them to a specified address.\n\nFor unwrapping Native Super Tokens (like ETHx), you can use the following function from the [ISETH interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISETH):\n1. `downgradeToETH(uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens back to native tokens.\n\n:::warning Approval for Wrapping\nBefore wrapping ERC20 tokens into Super Tokens, you need to approve the Super Token contract to spend your ERC20 tokens. This is not needed for unwrapping.\n:::\n\n## Live Code Example: Wrapping ERC20 to Super Token\n\nHere's a simple example of how to wrap an ERC20 token into a Super Token using ethers.js:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction WrapERC20ToSuperToken() {\n  const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState('');\n\n  const wrapTokens = async () => {\n    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n      try {\n        await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });\n        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n        const signer = provider.getSigner();\n\n        // ERC20 token contract - you need to replace this with the actual token address\n        const erc20Address = '0x123...'; // Replace with actual ERC20 token address\n        const erc20Abi = ['function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)'];\n        const erc20Contract = new ethers.Contract(erc20Address, erc20Abi, signer);\n\n        // Super Token contract - you need to replace this with the actual Super Token address\n        const superTokenAddress = '0x456...'; // Replace with actual Super Token address\n        const superTokenAbi = ['function upgrade(uint256 amount) external'];\n        const superTokenContract = new ethers.Contract(superTokenAddress, superTokenAbi, signer);\n\n        // Approve the Super Token contract to spend ERC20 tokens\n        const approveTx = await erc20Contract.approve(superTokenAddress, amount);\n        await approveTx.wait();\n        setStatus('Approval successful. Wrapping tokens...');\n\n        // Upgrade (wrap) ERC20 to Super Token\n        const upgradeTx = await superTokenContract.upgrade(amount);\n        await upgradeTx.wait();\n        setStatus('Tokens successfully wrapped!');\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error:', error);\n        setStatus('Error: ' + error.message);\n      }\n    } else {\n      setStatus('Please install MetaMask!');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={amount}\n        onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder=\"Amount to wrap\"\n      />\n      <button onClick={wrapTokens}>Wrap Tokens</button>\n      <p>{status}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n:::warning Replace Placeholder Addresses\nReplace the placeholder addresses in the code above with actual contract addresses of your ERC20 token and Super Token.\n:::\n\nThis example demonstrates how to:\n1. Connect to the user's wallet\n2. Approve the Super Token contract to spend ERC20 tokens\n3. Upgrade (wrap) ERC20 tokens to Super Tokens\n\nFor more detailed information about the ISuperToken interface and its functions, please refer to our [ISuperToken Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken).",

specifically made immutable in order to facilitate the interaction with [Distributions](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview.mdx) through the General Distribution Agreement (GDA).\n\nThis contract is optimized for interaction that would happen from outside the blockchain (off-chain).\nFor more information on the best practices regarding this interaction, please refer to the [SDK Section](/docs/sdk/quickstart) section of this documentation.\n\n## Contract Address\n\nThe `GDAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all Superfluid chains:\n\n```\n0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08\n```\n\n\n## ABI\n\nIn order to interact with the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract, you can use the following

It includes functions for interacting with Money Streaming and Distributions.\nIn order to have access to the library, you need to:\n\n- Import the library in your contract as such:\n\n    `import \"@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol\";`\n\n- Make sure that you include the `using` statement in your contract:\n\n    `using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;`\n\n\n:::note Note 1\nIn the case of interacting with Native Super Tokens you should use `using SuperTokenV1Library for ISETH;` instead.\n:::\n\n:::note Note 2\nIt is important to \"warm up\" the cache and cache the `host`, `cfa`, `gda` before calling,\nthis is only applicable to Foundry tests where the vm.expectRevert() will not work as expected.\nYou must use vm.startPrank(account) instead of vm.prank when executing functions if the cache\nisn't \"warmed up\" yet. vm.prank impersonates the account only for the first call, which will be\nused for caching.\n:::\n\n## Fn flowX\n\n```solidity\nfunction flowX(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    address receiverOrPool,\n    int96 flowRate\n) \n    internal \n    returns (bool)\n```\n_creates a flow to an account or to pool members.\nIf the receiver is an account, it uses the CFA, if it's a pool it uses the GDA._\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :---------- |\n| `token` | contract

calculate the needed buffer for |\n\n#### Return Values\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :---------- |\n| `bufferAmount` | uint256 | The buffer amount based on flowRate, liquidationPeriod and minimum deposit |\n\nthe returned amount is exact only for the scenario where no flow exists before.\nIn order to get the buffer delta for a delta flowrate, you need to get the buffer amount\nfor the new total flowrate and subtract the previous buffer.\nThat's because there's not always linear proportionality between flowrate and buffer.\nfor GDA flows, the required buffer is typically slightly lower.\nThat's due to an implementation detail (round-up \"clipping\" to 64 bit in the CFA).\nThe return value of this method is thus to be considered not a precise value, but a\nlower bound for GDA flows.\n\n## Fn flow\n\n```solidity\nfunction flow(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate\n) \n    internal \n    returns (bool)\n```\n_Sets the given CFA flowrate between the caller and a given receiver.\nIf there's no pre-existing flow and `flowRate` non-zero, a new flow is created.\nIf there's an existing flow and `flowRate` non-zero, the flowRate of that flow is updated.\nIf there's an existing flow and `flowRate` zero, the flow is deleted.\nIf the existing and given flowRate are equal, no action is taken.\nOn creation of a flow, a \"buffer\" amount is automatically detracted from the sender account's available balance.\nIf the sender account is solvent when the flow is deleted, this buffer is redeemed to it._\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :---------- |\n| `token` | contract ISuperToken | Super token address |\n| `receiver` | address | The receiver of the flow

Anyone can create Superfluid vesting schedules easily by using the no-code\nSuperfluid Dashboard or the Vesting Scheduler SDK built on a robust smart contract framework\n\n\n## Vesting with the Superfluid Dashboard (No-code)\n\n### Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard\n\nNavigate to the [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/vesting). Ensure you are connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Polygon Mumbai for testing or Ethereum mainnet for live transactions).\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/dashboard-vesting.png\" alt=\"Vesting Dashboard\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n:::note\nVesting via the dashboard requires a simple whitelisting. Register your interest to be whitelisted [here](https://airtable.com/appmq3TJDdQUrTQpx/shr6iaRWUXVZwVWSd).\n\n:::\n\n### Step 2: Creating the Vesting Schedule\nFill in the information below in order to create a vesting schedule:\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-schedule.gif\" alt=\"Create Vesting Schedule\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n1. **Receiver**: Enter the public address, ENS, or Lens of the recipient.\n2. **Super Token**: Select the Super Token you wish to vest. If you don't have super tokens, you can wrap your tokens using the [Super Token Wrapper](https://app.superfluid.finance/wrap).\n3. **Vesting Start Date**: Set the date and time when the vesting will start.\n4. **Total Vested Amount**: Input the total amount of tokens to be vested.\n5. **Total Vesting Period**: Specify the duration over which the tokens will vest.\n6. **Optional Cliff**: Toggle the 'Add Cliff' option and specify the cliff amount and period if needed.\n\n:::note\nThe \"cliff amount\" is the amount of tokens that will be vested at the start of the vesting period. For example, if you set a cliff of 100 tokens, the recipient will receive 100 tokens at the start of the vesting period, and the remaining tokens will be vested over the vesting period.\n:::\n\n### Step 3: Preview and Create\n\nAfter entering the vesting parameters, preview the vesting schedule to ensure everything is correct. Then, create the vesting schedule with a single transaction.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-preview.png\" alt=\"Vesting Preview\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n### Step 4: Sharing the Vesting Schedule\n\nA link to the vesting schedule status page can be shared with the recipient, providing them with an up-to-date view of their vesting progress.\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-ongoing.png\" alt=\"Vesting Custom Page\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n## Vesting using the Superfluid Vesting Scheduler (for Devs)\n\nThe Vesting Scheduler is a sophisticated smart contract designed for setting up token vesting schedules.\nIt's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient.\nThe contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream,\nensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the Vesting Scheduler, check out the Vesting Scheduler Automation [Full Guide](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/automations/vesting-scheduler).\n\nIf you have questions about how to build with this smart contract framework, don't hesitate to reach out to our team or community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pPzPEDMVua)!\n\n\n---\n\n## Benefits of Superfluid Vesting\n\nSuperfluid vesting offers:\n\n* **Simple UI**: A user-friendly interface allowing easy setup in just a few clicks.\n* **Full Liquidity**: Maintained liquidity for senders and immediate token flow for receivers.\n* **Composability**: The ability to transfer vested tokens seamlessly to DeFi products.\n* **Reduced Volatility**: Tokens are streamed every second, mitigating market volatility.\n* **Enhanced Security**: Safe streaming without locking tokens in a contract.\n* **No Custody**: Tokens are streamed directly to the recipient's wallet.\n\nFor a hands-on demonstration, try setting up a vesting schedule on the Superfluid Dashboard or explore building with the smart contract framework today.",

These reactions are facilitated through callbacks, allowing Super Apps to engage dynamically with the creation, modification, and termination of Super Agreements.\n\n## **Reacting to Super Agreements**\n\nThe reactivity of Super Apps stems from **callbacks**. These are segments of code within the Super App that are triggered when a Super Agreement involving the Super App is created, updated, or deleted. Such callbacks can execute various actions, from minting NFTs to initiating new Streams (Constant Flow Agreements).\n\n### **Example - Stream Consolidator Super App**\n\nConsider a Sup",
      'er App designed to consolidate all incoming flows into a single outgoing flow to a specific account (Account Z):\n\n1. **Incoming Flow from Account A**: Account A initiates a Money Stream to the Super App (100 USDCx/mo). The Super App, in turn, starts an outbound Stream of the same rate to Account Z.\n2. **Multiple Flow Adjustments**: If Account B starts a new Money Stream to the Super App (25 USDCx/mo) and Account A adjusts its flow (to 50 USDCx/mo), the Super App responds by updating its outbound Streams accordingly.\n3. **Ongoing Reactions**: The Super App continues to adapt to new Money Streams or adjustments from various accounts, maintaining a reactive outbound flow.\n\n<Admonition type="info">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: For a smart contract to qualify as a Super App, it must have defined callbacks to interact with Super Agreements.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Registering With The Protocol\n\nRegistration of a Super App with the Superfluid Protocol is crucial. This registration process involves coding',
      " the smart contract to be identifiable as a Super App within the protocol.\n\n### Purpose of Registration\n\n- **Protocol Recognition**: When a stream is initiated towards a contract, the Superfluid Protocol checks if the recipient is a registered Super App.\n- **Callback Activation**: If identified as a Super App, the protocol activates the Super App's callbacks, enabling its reactive capabilities.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![Super App Registration](/assets/image_(82).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Super App Registration*</p>\n</div>\n\n## Why Are Super Apps Needed?\n\nSuper Apps introduce a layer of programmability to Super Agreements, enhancing the potential for innovative decentralized applications (dApps).\n\n### Potential Use Cases\n\n- **Lending Applications**: Automate loan repayments through Streams, eliminating the need for manual transactions.\n- **Subscription Services**: Enable on-chain subscriptions ",
      "paid via Streams, incorporating features like automatic affiliate payouts.\n\nSuper Apps open up a realm of possibilities, combining custom logic with the functionalities of Super Agreements to craft unique and scalable dApps.\n\nFor further inspiration, explore the following examples of Super Apps:\n\n[Explore Super App Examples](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples)\n",

Interaction with a Super Agreement is typically done by calling [`callAgreement()`](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/interacting-with-superfluid-smart-contracts) on the Host Contract, specifying the agreement and parameters.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Upgradeabi",
      'lity and Expansion**: Super Agreements can be updated or new ones can be added and registered with the Host Contract.\n\n<Admonition type="info">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Direct interactions with Super Token contracts are not required for invoking Super Agreements. Instead, these agreements are accessed via the Host Contract, which then manages the Super Token balances involved.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Super Tokens 🔗 Host Contract\n\nSuper Tokens form the foundational layer of the Superfluid Protocol, where all Super Agreement data for an account is compiled.\n\n### Functionality\n\n- **Aggregated Balance Calculation**: The impact of each Super Agreement on an account\'s balance is cumulatively calculated to determine the Super Token balance.\n- **Data Sourcing**: Super Token contracts obtain necessary data through the Host Contract by iterating over the registered Super Agreements.\n\n## Super Apps 🔗 Host Contract\n\nRegistration of Super Apps with the Superfluid Host is essential to enable their callbac',
      "k functionalities.\n\n### Interaction Mechanics\n\n- **Registration Requirement**: Super Apps must be registered with the Host to function correctly.\n- **Callback Activation**: When a Super Agreement is engaged with a Super App, the Host Contract triggers the Super App's callbacks.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![Super Apps and Host Contract](/assets/image_(58).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Super Apps and Host Contract*</p>\n</div>\n\nIn summary, the Superfluid Host Contract is integral to the Superfluid Protocol, facilitating seamless interactions and integrations among Super Tokens, Super Agreements, and Super Apps.\n",

This allows pool members to transfer units among themselves, which wasn't possible earlier.\n- **Roles and Permissions**: A pool admin can grant and revoke units, while any account can act as a **distributor** to execute fund distributions.\n- **Distribution Methods**: There are two primary ways to distribute funds:\n  - **Instant Distribution**: Calculated as `distributionAmount * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.\n  - **Streaming Distribution**: Determined by `poolFlowRate * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.\n- **Gas Efficiency**: The cost of executing distributions remains constant, rega",
      'rdless of the number of pool members.\n\n### High-Level Workflow\n\n1. **Pool Creation**: Any account can create a pool and appoint a pool admin. This pool acts as a channel for distributing funds.\n2. **Unit Management**: The pool admin assigns units to members, representing their share in future distributions.\n3. **Member Connection**: Pool members can connect to or disconnect from the pool, affecting how they access distributed funds.\n4. **Distribution Execution**: Distributors can initiate either instant or streaming distributions, which are then divided among pool members based on their unit share.\n\n## Distribution Examples\n\n### Streaming Distribution Illustration\n\nThis diagram shows a distributor streaming funds to various pool members, each holding different unit amounts.

      '---\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\n# What is Superfluid?\n\n## Introduction\n\nSuperfluid is the [Money Streaming](/docs/concepts/overview/money-streaming) protocol.\nThe goal of this protocol is to build an ecosystem of apps and services that onboard people to earn every second in a consistent, sustainable way onchain.\nThis is made possible by the protocol’s smart contract framework which introduces\nthe [Super Token](/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens) - an extension to the ERC-20 standard enabling continuous and highly scalable onchain cash flows.\n\n## Super Tokens\n\nThe Superfluid protocol is designed to be a "token-centric" protocol, in that all of its functionalities revolve around the concept of [Super Tokens](./overview/super-tokens.mdx).\nThe framework & Super Token standard can be used to add dynamic balances to tokens on chain,\ndescribing cash flows and executing them automatically over time in a non-interactive way.\nAny token can be transferred in Superfluid streams or distributions, wh',
      "ich are programmable, composable, and modular.\nNo capital is locked up, and all inflows and outflows are netted in real-time at every block without consuming any gas.\nThe code is fully open source, while the protocol is non-custodial and permissionless.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/Superfluid-main-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of the Superfluid Protocol*</p>\n</div>\n\n**The Superfluid Protocol has currently two main pillars that define its interactions with Super Tokens. These pillars (formerly called Agreements) are the following:**\n- [***Money Streaming***](./overview/money-streaming.mdx) - A set of features that enable the creation of money streams between two parties.\n- [***Distributions***](./overview/distributions.mdx) - A set of features that enables the creation of a pool of funds that can be distributed to multipl",
      "e recipients.\n\nWe go in further details about these two pillars in the next sections.\n\n## Money Streaming\n\n### Definition\n\nMoney Streaming is a continuous transfer of tokens from a sender to a receiver at a defined per-second rate, resulting in a \"stream\". This stream is perpetual and persists until it's canceled by either the sender or the receiver, or until the sender's Super Token balance is depleted.\n\n### Explanation\n\nMoney Streaming is a novel approach to token transfers, offering a dynamic way of sending funds. Instead of one-time transactions, tokens flow from the sender to the receiver continuously, creating a stream. This method provides real-time financial transactions, enabling a more fluid movement of assets over time, reflecting real-world economic activities more closely.\n\n### Example\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/Superfluid-GIF.gif\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justi",
      "fyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of money streaming from the [Superfluid dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/)*</p>\n</div>\n\nConsider Alice wants to pay Bob a salary of 1200 USDCx per year using Money Streaming. She sets up a stream with a flow rate of 0.038 USDCx per second. Bob's balance starts increasing every second, and Alice's decreases, ensuring a steady transfer of salary.\n\n## Distributions\n\n### Definition\n\nDistributions in Superfluid refer to a scalable one-to-many fund transfer method. It involves creating pools with a pool admin managing units for members, who can receive funds instantly or through continuous streaming.\n\n### Explanation\n\nDistributions are a significant advancement in decentralized finance, enabling efficient and scalable fund transfers among multiple recipients. This method is especially useful for scenarios where funds need to be distributed among many parties, like dividends or rewards, ensuring equitable and automated distribution base",
      "d on predefined units.\n\n### Example\n\nImagine a DeFi project creating a reward pool for liquidity providers. The project sets up a distribution pool with a total of 1000 units. If a liquidity provider has 100 units, they receive 10% of the total funds distributed through the pool, either instantly or as a continuous stream, depending on the distribution method.\n\n",

When your Super Token balance reaches a certain lower threshold, Auto-Wrap steps in and wraps enough tokens into the needed Super Token on your behalf to ensure you never run out of balance, as that would make all streams stop.\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://www.notion.so/superfluidhq/Setting-Up-Superfluid-Auto-Wrap-9a565d53bbee4bdc953cc2a656c43761\"\n      className=\"button-link\"\n      style={{\n         backgroundColor: 'green',\n         color: 'white',\n         fontSize: '16px',\n         padding: '10px 20px',\n         textDecoration: 'none',\n         borderRadius: '4px',\n         display: 'inline-block'\n      }}\n   >\n      Click here for full a guide on how to set up an Auto-Wrap Automation\n  ",
      " </a>\n</div>\n\n## Why Auto-Wrap?\n\nMost organizations don’t hold their assets as Super Tokens. DAOs are more likely to hold USDC than USDCx in their treasury to limit exposure to third party protocols. So when a DAO is paying contributors in streams of USDCx they need to ensure they periodically wrap additional USDC in USDCx to keep their streams running. This can be a tedious manual process because it requires you to:\n\n1. Periodically check the Super Token balance to make sure it isn’t reaching zero.\n2. If it is approaching zero, manually wrap additional USDC to USDCx to avoid running out of USDCx balance.\n\nWith Auto-Wrap, this manual process is fully automated. The system keeps monitoring a wallet balance of a specific token (i.e. USDC) and when it’s too low (normally less than 2 days worth of outgoing streaming) it automatically wraps a variable amount (normally 7 days worth of outgoing streaming) to keep streams running over time. All payroll admin needs to do is ensure they’re holdi",
      "ng enough USDC in their wallet - the wrapping part is taken care of by Auto-Wrap.\n\n## Example\n\n1. Auto-Wrap identifies that the DAO’s DAIx balance is running low. In this example, it’s less than a two days away from running out of DAIx.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n![Auto-Wrap identifying low balance](/assets/image_(5)_(3)_(1).png)\n</div>\n\n2.

No manual triggering required!\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n![Auto-Wrap replenishing balance](/assets/image_(8).png)\n</div>\n\n## Setting Up Auto-Wrap\n\nTo set up Auto-Wrap for your organization, follow the detailed guide available here:\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://www.notion.so/superfluidhq/Setting-Up-Superfluid-Auto-Wrap-9a565d53bbee4bdc953cc2a656c43761\"\n      className=\"button-link",

Schedule both the start and end of a new stream.\n\nThis functionality is accessible directly from the Superfluid Dashboard after [approval for access](https://use.superfluid.finance/schedulestreams) and can also be implemented using underlying contracts and off-chain automations.\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://superfluidhq.notion.site/Setting-Up-Stream-Scheduling-551888de690e402caee50e8d87cb6930\"\n      className=\"button-link\"\n      style={{\n         backgroundColor: 'green',\n         color: 'white',\n         fontSize: '16px',\n         padding: '10px 20px',\n         textDecoration: 'none',\n         borderRadius: '4px',\n         display: 'inline-block'\n      }}\n   >\n ",

This is particularly useful for applications like payroll, subscriptions, and token vesting. By default, Superfluid streams are perpetual, running until manually canceled or until the balance is depleted. The Stream Scheduler allows for automated stream management, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n\n## Example:\n\nConsider the following scenario, visualized in these [Miro diagrams](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP--AM4I=/?share_link_id=524959909457):\n\n1. **Stream Scheduling**:\n   On January 1st, you grant operator permissions to the Stream Scheduler contract and schedule a stream with the following details:\n   \n   - **Flow Rate**: 100 DAIx/mo.\n   - **To**: Alice’s account\n   - **Start**: March 1st, 2023, at 12:00 am\n   - **End**: March 20th, 2023, at 12:00 am\n   \n   \n   <br",

It's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient. The contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream, ensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.\n\nWhile the integration of the Vesting Scheduler into the Superfluid Dashboard is forthcoming, it's already possible to interact directly with the contract alongside off-chain automations. Detailed instructions for setting up automated vesting can be found in the documentation.\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px' }}>\n   <a \n      href=\"https://www.notion.so/superfluidhq/Setting-Up-Automated-Vesting-f3e11a257a2d4b0b89210def5",

With this system, you can:\n\n- Implement linear vesting schedules with customizable cliffs.\n- Specify both the cliff date/time and amount.\n- Determine your total vesting amount and its time frame.\n- Retain all tokens in your wallet or Safe until they're transferred to the recipient.\n\n## Example:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: On January 1st, you aim to vest 400 AMZNx to Alice from February 1st to June 1st. The vesting schedule includes a cliff of 100 AMZNx on Mar",

No action is needed on February 1st due to the cliff.\n\n   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n   ![Cliff Execution](/assets/image_(2)_(1).png)\n   </div>\n\n3. **Completion of Vesting**: By June 1st, the vesting process is complete, and the stream to Alice is cancelled.\n\n   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n   ![Completion of Vesting](/assets/image_(12)_(2).png)\n   </div>\n\n## Setting Up Vesting Scheduling\n\nThe scheduler's integration with Superfluid streams adds an extra layer of convenience, eliminating the need for manual intervention once the schedule is set.

By leaving their streams open for too long, stream creators stand to lose this `buffer`. This mechanism creates the main incentive for users to close their Superfluid streams before running out of tokens. It is a user's own responsibility to close their stream.\n\n`superApps` can also draw an `owedDeposit`, allowing them to open a stream of the same size, without needing an initial balance.\n\nHere's the general flow of solvency states for Super Tokens in a Constant Flow Agreement (Money Streaming):\n\n#### 1. Solvent\n\nEveryone is in good standing. The sender's balance is greater than 0. The stream flows to the receiver as expected, and there are enough tokens to back the stream.\n\n#### 2. Critical\n\nThe sender's balance is now zero, and the permissions on the stream n",
      "ow allow anyone to close it. Until the stream is actually closed, funds are paid to the receiver's wallet using the sender's initial `buffer`.\n\nThe critical period is subdivided into 2 sub-periods:\\\na) _**Patrician Period**_: starts when the stream becomes critical (duration defined as governance parameter)\\\nb) _**Plebs Period**_: spans the remaining timeframe until the stream becomes insolvent\n\nWhen the stream is closed, any remaining `buffer` is taken and assigned/distributed either to the _**PIC**_ or a _**Pleb**_.\\\nIf the stream is closed during the Plebs Period, we call the account closing the stream a Pleb.\n\n#### 3. Insolvent\n\nIf the stream isn't closed, and the sender's deposit is completely consumed, then the insolvent period begins. The stream will continue to the receiver, however since these tokens don't actually exist in the sender's wallet, we must keep track of this `deficit` so that the Super Token itself can remain solvent within the Superfluid Protocol.\\\nWe also call t",
      'his open ended timeframe the _**Pirate Period**_.\n\nWhen the stream is eventually closed, the `deficit` is taken from the PICs stake as a slashing fee. This slashing fee is then burned, to offset the tokens created by the insolvent stream. Additionally, a reward equal in amount to the `buffer` amount before its consumption is issued to the account closing the stream, whom we call a _**Pirate.**_. This reward is also detracted from the PICs stake.\n\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  ![Buffer and\n  balance](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/X7ShIBo-weuUDIVwxj4Klj0VNy0PNP7ajC9zNC9WxiCOMkPDfhjpK4YpNJQ8i1Oor2OjDYzxr1493JxtCU4ycHwU7lZ9rRkiwm4mRQEA9xTDybxd4WXht3JW95U6qEqEvSHA60zi)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <p>\n    *Visualization showing the tota user balance as well as the outgoing stream\n    part of the buffer*\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n### Patricians, Plebs and Pirates (3Ps)\n\nEach token has an account called a _**PIC (Patrician in Ch',
      "arge)**_.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Critical during the Patrician Period, the remaining amount of the `buffer` balance of the closed stream is taken and added to the PICs stake as a reward.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Critical during the Plebs Period, the remaining buffer is rewarded to the Pleb.\n\nEvery time a stream is closed while Insolvent, the PIC is slashed, and the Pirate is rewarded with the full buffer amount.\n\nThe monopoly on rewards during the Patrician Period gives PICs an incentive to make sure streams are closed during that timeframe.\\\nThey can set up one or multiple redundant instances of the [superfluid-sentinel](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-sentinel) (and/or other mechanisms for closing streams) to ensure this. Note that the PIC account is not needed (not in a _hot wallet_) for this operations as the rewards incurred during the patrician period will be added to the PIC stake regardless of transaction sender.\n\nPlebs act as a fallba",
      "ck in case PICs fail to do their job despite of the incentives.\\\nThe earlier in the Pleb Period a Pleb closes the stream, the more buffer there's left as a reward.\n\nUnlike the PIC, individual Plebs and Pirates don't have a monopoly. Whoever manages to get a stream closing transaction included first during the Plebs / Pirate Period, gets the reward.\n\nPatrician, Pleb and Pirate are roles which map to accounts in specific circumstances.\\\nThe same account could have any of those roles in the context of various stream closing transactions, defined by the timing of that transaction and the state of the TOGA contract (list of PICs) at the time of transaction execution. The reference sentinel implementation provides configuration options influencing that behaviour and timing of transactions.\n\nNote that thanks to this flexible roles model, PICs have an incentive to close streams even after missing the Patrician Period:\n\n1. they can still get rewards, essentially acting as a Pleb or Pirate in th",
      "e context of that transaction\n2. due to the slashing of the `deficit` from their stake, their incentive to close insolvent streams grows linearly over time\n\n![Toga payoff table](</assets/image_(72).png>)\n\n### TOGA - Transparent OnGoing Auction\n\nSince the role of a PIC comes with a monopoly on rewards incurred during the Patrician Period, a fair mechanism for assigning this role is needed. Such a mechanism is provided by the TOGA.\n\nTo become a PIC for a token, aspiring Patricians must post a `stake` to the TOGA contract, in the token they are trying to become a PIC for. If the new `stake` is higher than the existing `stake`, the new Patrician becomes the PIC, and the previous Patrician gets their current `stake` back.\n\nPICs can't remove their `stake` at will through a single transaction, but rather, they have to specify an `exitRate`, which defines the flowrate of a Stream to their account. The `exitRate` is also not completely arbitrary, it is limited such that the `stake` will remain ",
      "above zero for at least a week.\n\nAll liquidation rewards are added to the `stake`, thus - depending on the exitRate set by the PIC and the number of size of streams becoming critical - the stake of a PIC could shrink, grow or stay the same over time. (The maximum allowed `exitRate` is calculated based on the worst case of no rewards being added during that timeframe.)\n\nIn order to become the PIC, you can either use the Dapp at https://toga.superfluid.finance/ or use `ERC777.send()` to post the desired stake to the TOGA contract - optionally with an `exitRate` set in the `data` parameter if you don't like the default `exitRate`. The TOGA contract implements an ERC777 callback for the auction mechanism.\n\n:::warning CAUTION\nDo NOT use `ERC20.transfer()` for TOGA bids, because those may not trigger the needed callback in the future.\n:::\n\n### Current Parameters\n\n<Tabs\n    defaultValue=\"polygon\"\n    values={[\n        { label: 'Polygon', value: 'polygon' },\n        { label: 'Ethereum Mainnet'",

If however the sender account has incoming streams, this timeframes are stretched proportionally. If for example the aggregate incoming flowrate is ',
      "half of the aggregate outgoing flowrate, the time for the buffer to be consumed (critial period) doubles, as do the patrician period and the plebs period. If the aggregate incoming flowrate equals the aggregate outgoing flowrate (net flowrate = zero), those periods become potentially infinite (as long as the net flowrate doesn't change), because in that case the buffer wouldn't be consumed further, but not restored either, leaving outgoing streams critical in perpetuity.\n\n\\\nFor the TOGA `exitPeriod`, something similar applies - it's the lower bound for how long it would take a PIC to stream out the stake with a given `exitRate`, assuming nothing is added to the stake during that time. In practice, accrued liquidation rewards may be added to the stake during that time, leading to a proportional extension of the exitPeriod. In theory such added rewards could even completely offset the exitRate, leading to a net growing stake. In that case the PIC could periodically increase the exitRate ",
      "(a larger stake allows for a larger exitRate) and would eventually be able to set an exitRate which leads to a shrinking stake.\n",

The protocol checks if a Super App is involved in a transaction and, if so, executes the relevant callbacks.\n\n### Anatomy of Super App Callbacks\n\nBelow are examples of Super App callbacks and their structure:\n\n```solidity\nfunction beforeAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n) external view virtual override returns (bytes memory /*cbdata*/) {\n    revert("Unsupported callback - Before Agreement Created");\n}\n```\n\n```solidity\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*cbdata*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n) extern',
      'al virtual override returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {\n    revert("Unsupported callback - After Agreement Created");\n}\n```\n\n#### Callback Execution\n\n* `beforeAgreement` callbacks are executed before the corresponding agreement contract action. They are `view` functions and can return data to be used in `afterAgreement` callbacks.\n* `afterAgreement` callbacks are executed after the agreement contract action. They can implement logic based on the outcome of the agreement action and the data returned from `beforeAgreement` callbacks.\n\n#### Callback Parameters\n\n* **`ISuperToken`**: The Super Token used in the transaction.\n* **`address`**: Address of the Constant Flow Agreement contract.\n* **`agreementId`**: A unique identifier for the agreement.\n* **`agreementData`**: Encoded data of the agreement details.\n* **`cbdata`**: Data returned from `beforeAgreement` callbacks (applicable to `afterAgreement` callbacks).\n* **`ctx`**: Context of the transaction, essential for understanding the backg',
      "round of the callback invocation.\n\n### Utilizing Callbacks\n\nUnderstanding and effectively using these callbacks is crucial for Super App developers. Each callback serves a specific purpose and offers the flexibility to execute custom logic in response to changes in Super Agreements.\n\n## CallAgreement vs CallAgreementWithContext\n\nIf you're making a call to a Superfluid agreement inside of a Super App callback, you should remember that you need to \"receive a context, and return a context\" by using the `callAgreementWithContext` function. If you're not making this call inside of a Super App callback, you should use `callAgreement`.\n\n\n:::note\nNote that this is a highly technical section for those looking to understand lower level features of the protocol. If you're looking to create, update, and delete streams or work with the instant distribution agreement in your super app callbacks, you can refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/blob/main",
      "/projects/tradeable-cashflow/contracts/RedirectAll.sol#L223) to perform these operations in a single line of code.\n:::\n\n### In Depth\n\nWhen calling the host contract to trigger actions related to the constant flow agreement (CFA) or instant distribution agreement (IDA), you may use either `callAgreement` or `callAgreementWithContext`. Both of these functions allow you to pass in an encoded call to the agreement you'd like to interact with, as well as an optional `userData` value. The `callAgreementWithContext` function will perform the same actions as the `callAgreement` function, but it also enables you to pass in a new context value (abbreviated `ctx` ) to your function call.\n\nKeep in mind that `callAgreementWithContext` is designed for use within Super Apps - if this function is run outside of a Super App, then `callAgreementWithContext` will fail due to this statement:\n\n``` solidity\nrequire(\n    context.appAddress == msg.sender,  \n    \"SF: callAgreementWithContext from wrong address",
      "\"\n);\n```\n\n`callAgreementWithContext` is primarily meant for use within Super App callbacks. Each Super App callback will be passed a context value (`ctx`) from the host contract (as the Superfluid host contract is the _caller_ of each callback). This `ctx` value is what needs to be passed to any call you want to make to the Superfluid host contract _inside_ of your callback (this goes for all operations which create, update, and delete flows in these callbacks). As a reminder, the logic within the 'host' contract can be found in `Superfluid.sol`.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//a function which we'll use to create a flow within a callback\nfunction _createFlowInCallback(\n        bytes calldata ctx,\n        ISuperfluid _host, \n        IConstantFlowAgreementV1 _cfa,    \n        ISuperfluidToken _acceptedToken,\n        address _receiver, \n        int96 _flowRate\t\n    )\n\tprivate\n\treturns (bytes memory newCtx)\n ",

      'y, which abstracts away the need to use `host.callAgreement` or `host.callAgreementWithContext` directly.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\nusing CFALibraryV1 for CFALibraryV1.InitData;\n\n    //initialize cfaV1 variable\n    CFALibraryV1.InitData public cfaV1; \n\n    constructor(\n        ISuperfluid host\n    ) {\n\n    //initialize InitData struct, and set equal to cfaV1\n    cfaV1 = CFALibraryV1.InitData(\n       host,\n       IConstantFlowAgreementV1(\n\t  address(host.getAgreementClass(\n           keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n\t   ))\n        )\n     );\n   }\n\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n//passing in the ctx',

If you do this, you can save the value returned by the first `callAgreementWithContext` function to a new variable, then pass this value to your next call to `callAgreementWithContext` . The takeaway here is that you need to pass the most recent iteration of `ctx` when creating, updating, or deleting flows inside Super App callbacks. You can see this done here with the CFA Library:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\nusing CFALibraryV1 for CFALibraryV1.InitData;\n\n    //initialize cfaV1 variable\n    CFALibraryV1.InitData public cfaV1; \n\n    constructor(\n        ISuperfluid host\n    ) {\n\n    //initialize InitData str",
      'uct, and set equal to cfaV1\n    cfaV1 = CFALibraryV1.InitData(\n       host,\n       IConstantFlowAgreementV1(\n\t  address(host.getAgreementClass(\n           keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n\t    ))\n        )\n     );\n   }\n\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n   newCtx = cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(_ctx, receiver, token, flowRate); //passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n   newCtx = cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(newCtx, receiver, token, flowRate); //passing in the ctx which is returned from the first call here\n\t\t\t \n}\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nOne final item to note is to not manually change the value of `ctx` when it\'s used within a Super App. `Ctx` ',
      "is formatted in a very specific way within a struct that is compiled to bytecode by the protocol, and it's not meant to be manipulated directly. If you wish to pass in userData to your function call, this can be done by simply adding the `userData` value in as a parameter:\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the code</summary>\n<p>\n```solidity\n//using the CFA Library:\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n{\n   //passing in the ctx which is sent to the callback here\n   //createFlowWithCtx makes use of callAgreementWithContext\n   return cfaV1.createFlowWithCtx(_ctx, receiver, token, flowRate, userData);\n}\n\n//using a low level call\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken _superToken,",
      "\n    address _agreementClass,\n    bytes32, // _agreementId,\n    bytes calldata /*_agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata ,// _cbdata,\n    bytes calldata _ctx\n)\n    external override\n    onlyExpected(_superToken, _agreementClass)\n    onlyHost\n    returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n  {\n\tnewCtx = _ctx;\n\t (newCtx,) = _host.callAgreementwithContext(\n\t      _cfa,\n\t      abi.encodeWithSelector(\n\t      _cfa.deleteFlow.selector,\n\t      _acceptedToken,\n\t      address(this),\n\t      _receiver,\n        new bytes(0) // placeholder\n      ),\n      userData, //userData goes here\n      newCtx //passing in the context from the super app callback\n   );\t\n }\n\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nIf you read through the Superfluid codebase, you'll see that nearly every state changing operation will return a context value. This `ctx` value helps to provide additional internal accounting for the protocol to enhance security, and it allows you to decode it and make use of values like userData inside Super Apps. When making call",
      "s within your Super Apps, keep in mind that you need to pass in updated context values if you want to make use of the callbacks properly. Remember: if you need to run callAgreement within a Super App callback, you'll need to use `callAgreementWithContext` and pass in `ctx`.\n",

This registration is crucial for enabling the Super App\'s business logic to be invoked via agreement hooks.\n\n## Registration Process\n\n### Basic Registration\n\nYou can \n\n1. Use the `registerApp` method of the host contract.\n2. Two ways to register:\n   - Self-registration: `registerApp(configWord)`\n   - Registration by another account: `registerApp(app, configWord)`\n\n\n\n### Permissioned vs. Non-Permissioned Networks\n\nSome networks require additional steps for Super App registration. Here\'s how to check:\n\n1. Query `host.APP_WHITE_LISTING_ENABLED()` on your target network.\n2. You can do this via the Superfluid Explorer:\n   - Go to the "protocol" section (e.g., [Polygon Mainnet Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/matic/protocol))\n   - Click the Explorer link for "Host"\n   - Navigate to C',
      'ontract -> Read as Proxy\n   - Expand "WHITE_LISTING_ENABLED"\n\n![Superfluid Explorer Screenshot](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/assets/5479136/442b460c-d1e9-419e-8483-12235ca19f0a)\n\n- If `false`: Standard registration process applies\n- If `true`: Follow the permissioned registration process below\n\n## Permissioned App Registration\n\nIf your target network requires permissioned registration:\n\n1. Get a "deployer" account whitelisted (can be an EOA or a contract)\n2. Choose your deployment strategy:\n\n   a) For a single Super App:\n   - Register in the constructor or initialize method\n   - Use `host.registerApp(configWord)`\n   - Whitelist the EOA making this transaction\n\n   b) For multiple Super App instances (e.g., factory pattern):\n   - Whitelist a contract as the deployer\n   - Use `host.registerApp(app, configWord)` from this contract\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Using `registerApp(configWord)`: `tx.origin` must be whitelisted\n- Using `registerApp(app, configWord)`: `msg.',
      "sender` must be whitelisted\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you need assistance or have questions about the process:\n1. Join our [Discord](http://discord.superfluid.finance/)\n2. Contact the Superfluid dev team in the #development channel\n\n## Code Examples\n\nHere are some basic examples to illustrate the registration process:\n\n```solidity\n// Self-registration in constructor\nconstructor(ISuperfluid host, uint256 configWord) {\n    host.registerApp(configWord);\n}\n\n// Registration by another account\nfunction registerSuperApp(ISuperfluid host, ISuperApp app, uint256 configWord) external {\n    host.registerApp(app, configWord);\n}\n```\n\nRemember to adjust these examples based on your specific Super App implementation and network requirements.",

They are similar to ERC777 hooks but for Super Agreements.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    ![The Tradeable Cashflow NFT](/assets/image_(29)_(1).png)\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*The Tradeable Cashflow NFT*</p>\n</div>\n\nSuper Apps can execute custom logic in response to streaming-related actions. A great example is the [tradeable cashflow NFT contract](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/super-examples/tree/c784d239557d6fb5e56a2c8951ac4353256d611d/projects/tradeable-cashflow), which automatically opens a new stream from the NFT contract to the owner of the NFT upon receiving a stream.\n\nCallbacks in Super",
      ' Apps are triggered by these actions:\n\n1. A flow is opened with the Super App as the `receiver`.\n2. A flow involving the Super App as the `receiver` is updated.\n3. A flow is closed by the Super App\'s counterparty.\n\nThese callbacks can execute any arbitrary logic, enabling a wide range of possibilities for Super Apps.\n\n### Super App Configuration\n\nSuper Apps need to be registered with the Superfluid Protocol to use callbacks. Here\'s how to register a Super App:\n\n<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">\n{`\n// Example registration code for a Super App\nuint256 configWord =\n    SuperAppDefinitions.APP_LEVEL_FINAL |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_CREATED_NOOP |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_UPDATED_NOOP |\n    SuperAppDefinitions.BEFORE_AGREEMENT_TERMINATED_NOOP;\n\nstring memory registrationKey = ""; // Can be empty for testnet deployments\n\n_host.registerAppWithKey(configWord, registrationKey);\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\nThe `APP_LEVEL_FINAL` flag ensures that the callbacks run i',
      "n the first app in a chain of Super Apps. The `_NOOP` designations specify which callbacks are not used, avoiding unnecessary reverts.\n\nFor mainnet deployments, pre-approval is required for registering Super Apps. Check out the [Super App White-listing Guide](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/Super-App-White-listing-Guide) for more information.\n\n### Super App Stream Buffers\n\nWhen creating a Superfluid stream, an up-front buffer is taken to ensure the protocol's security. These deposits vary based on whether the stream is sent to a Super App and whether it's on testnet or mainnet.\n\nFor example, on testnets, the deposit is 1 hour x `flowRate` for non-Super Apps and up to 2 hours x `flowRate` for Super Apps. On mainnet, these values are 4 hours and 8 hours x `flowRate`, respectively.\n\n### Super App Callbacks\n\nSuper App callbacks are triggered in response to certain actions in Superfluid agreements:\n\n- When a stream is created, updated, or closed involving a Supe",
      'r App.\n- Before and after these actions occur, different callbacks are executed.\n\nCallback Anatomy:\n\n<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">\n{`\nfunction beforeAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n)\n    external\n    view\n    virtual\n    override\n    returns (bytes memory /*cbdata*/)\n{\n    revert("Unsupported callback - Before Agreement Created");\n}\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\n<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">\n{`\nfunction afterAgreementCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address /*agreementClass*/,\n    bytes32 /*agreementId*/,\n    bytes calldata /*agreementData*/,\n    bytes calldata /*cbdata*/,\n    bytes calldata /*ctx*/\n)\n    external\n    virtual\n    override\n    returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/)\n{\n    revert("Unsupported callback - After Agreement Created");\n}\n`}\n</CodeBlock>\n\n### Super App Rules (Jail System)\n\nSuper Apps must comply wit',
      'h specific rules to avoid being jailed. These rules ensure the security and proper functioning of the protocol.\n\n1. Super Apps cannot revert in the termination callback.\n2. Super Apps must not become insolvent.\n3. Operations within the termination callback must adhere to a gas limit.\n4. The `ctx` data must be correctly handled in the termination callback.\n\n#### Checking for Jailing\n\nTo check if a Super App is jailed, call `isAppJailed` on the Superfluid Host contract with the Super App\'s address. This can be done on Etherscan or through the Superfluid subgraph.\n\n<Admonition type="note">\n  For more details on the Jail system and Super App rules, visit the [Superfluid documentation](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid).\n</Admonition>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSuper Apps offer a versatile framework for building complex, reactive financial applications on the Superfluid Protocol.

      "repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/audits).\n\n## General Security Tips For Superfluid Developers\n\n- We recommend what every good security expert would recommend: full test coverage, separation of concerns, and using automated tools like GitHub Actions or [Trail of Bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/03/23/use-our-suite-of-ethereum-security-tools/)' tools for fuzzing & static analysis\n  - Guides like [this one from Consensys](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/) can be helpful in understanding what to think about before deploying smart contracts to mainnet.\n  - If you're looking for inspiration on setting up your own GitHub Actions pipelines, you can find a breakdown of Superfluid's own GitHub Actions setup [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/Superfluid-GitHub-Actions-Deep-Dive).\n- Beyond this, we recommend that you continue to think about security & potential ",
      "for loss of funds in the front end and off-chain components of your project (if you have them).\n  - For example, we highly recommend you adopt some of the same UX practices that we do in the [Superfluid dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/) if you have a front end that allows people to create Superfluid streams.\n  - I.e., we let the user know that letting their balance hit zero before they close their stream will [lead to a liquidation](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/solvency/liquidations-and-toga).\n\n### Security Tips for Building Super Apps\n\n- Be careful that your application does not get jailed unexpectedly.\n- We have detailed information [here](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/super-apps/super-app#super-app-rules-jail-system) regarding the jail system and how to avoid a jailed Super App, but one of the most common reasons for a jailed super app is an unexpected revert in either the `beforeAgreementTerminated` or `afterAgreementTerminated` callbacks.\n\n### C",
      "ustom Super Tokens\n\n- In general, we advise sticking to the existing Super Token interfaces seen [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/tokens) unless you have a good reason not to.\n- If you want to deviate from this, we strongly encourage you to reach out to the Superfluid developer team in the #dev-support channel in our [Discord](https://discord.superfluid.finance).\n",

      "mentation in our [codebase](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo). \n:::\n\n## What is a Pool?\n\nA pool is a smart contract that facilitates the distribution of tokens to multiple members, managed by a pool admin. Members hold units within the pool that determine their proportion of the distribution.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n<PoolsVisualization/>\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*A visualization of units in a pool*</p>\n</div>\n\n:::note\n\nThe Superfluid pool implements basic ERC20 functionality, allowing it to interact seamlessly with [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) standards.\nThis allows you to interact with the pool units as if they were ERC20 tokens, including transferring them to other addresses, if it is allowed by the pool configuration.\nCheck the [next section](#important-functions) for more information on pool configurations.\n\n:::\n\n## About Member Units\n\n### How i",
      "s a member's share of the pool determined?\n\nA pool member's units determine their share of the pool's distributions.\nIn the background, the calculation of each member's share is calculated following these two steps:\n\n1. **Calculating the flow rate per unit:** We calculate the flow rate or amount of tokens to be distributed *per unit* like so:\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/flowrate-formula.png\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"400\" />\n</div>\n<br/>\n2. **Calculating the flow rate for each member:** We multiply the flow rate per unit by the number of units each member has to get the flow rate for each member, as follows:\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/assets/flowrate-member-units.png\" alt=\"Superfluid with people\" width=\"500\" />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\nOne of the limitations of Solidity is its incapacity to handle floating point numbers. \nThis makes it so that the flow rate per unit is calculated as an",
      " integer. If the result of the division is not an integer, the result is rounded down.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples below show how the flow rate per unit is calculated in different scenarios where Distributions reach their limitations\n\n1. **Example 1:** Let's take a pool that has 100 wei/second as total flow rate and 3 members, each member has 1 unit.\n    - The flow rate per unit is 100 / 3 = 33.33\n    - However, since Solidity can't handle floating point numbers, the flow rate per unit is 33\n    - The pool distributes 33 tokens to each unit\n    - 1 token is left undistributed\n2. **Example 2:** Let's take a pool that has 100 wei/second as total flow rate and 200 members, each member has 1 units.\n    - The flow rate per unit is 100 / 200 = 0.5\n    - However, since Solidity can't handle floating point numbers, the flow rate per unit is 0\n    - The pool distributes 0 tokens to each unit\n    - 200 tokens are left undistributed\n\nThese examples are extreme and almost never happen in practice.",
      " However, it is important to be aware of these limitations when designing your pools.\n\n:::tip How to design your pools?\nThe best way to design your pools is to make sure that the total flow rate or the tokens distributed are always orders of magnitude higher than the number of total units in the pool.\nThis way, you can be sure that the flow rate per unit will always be significantly higher than 0 and that all members will receive a share of the distribution.\n:::\n\n## About Pool Connections and Claiming\n\n### What is the difference between connecting to a pool and claiming tokens?\nAfter creating a pool and assigning units to pool members,\nthey need to connect to the pool or claim their Super Tokens in order for it to show on their balance.\nSimply assigning units (shares) to a member does not automatically reflect in their balance.\nThe accumulated tokens NEED to be claimed by the member (or a different address), or the member needs to connect to the pool\nto start receiving their share of t",
      "he Super Token Distributions.\n\n### How can members collect their Distributions from the pool?\n\nThere are two ways for members to get their streamed or transferred Super Tokens from a pool:\n- **Connecting to the Pool (Recommended)**: Members should connect to the pool to start receiving their share of the Super Token Distributions in real time to their balance.\nThis includes both Instant Distributions and Streaming Distributions. In order to connect to the pool, the member should call the `connectPool` function from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-connectpool).\nThe address calling the function should be the address of the member. Other addresses will not be able to connect a member to the pool.\n\n- **Claiming the Tokens**: Members can claim their share of the Super Token Distributions accumulated from the pool at any time,\neven if they are not connected to the pool. As a matter of",
      " fact, anyone can claim the tokens on behalf of the member. To do so, the function\n`claimAll` from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-claimall) should be called with the address of the member as the argument.\n\n:::note Connecting to the pool includes claiming\nWhen a member connects to the pool, they automatically claim the accumulated tokens and start receiving the distributions in real time.\n:::\n\n:::tip Reminder\nWe use the `SuperTokenV1Library` to interact with the Superfluid protocol [on-chain](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/distributions-and-super-tokens/on-chain) (from your smart contracts),\nwhile we use the forwarders (eg. `GDAv1Forwarder`) to interact with the Superfluid protocol [off-chain](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/distributions-and-super-tokens/off-chain) (from your web3 frontend applications).\n:::\n\n:::tip Recommendation\nIt is recommended to prompt users to c",
      "onnect to the pool as soon as possible to start receiving the distributions in real time.\nDepending on your use case, periodic claiming may also offer the best UX, however pool connections usually offer\nthe best UX for real-time distributions.\n:::\n\n### How can members disconnect from the pool?\nMembers can always disconnect from the pool to stop receiving distributions in real time by calling the function `disconnectPool` from the [`SuperTokenV1Library`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) or [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder#fn-disconnectpool).\n\n### Example\n- **Jake** creates a pool and assigns 100 units to **Alice**, 200 units to **Bob**, and 200 units to **Charlie**.\n- **Alice** connects to the pool before any Distribution is made. Thus, she's able to receive her share of the Distributions in real time when they start.\n- **Jake** starts a stream of 100 tokens/second to the pool.\n- **Alice** receives 20 tokens/second directly into her balance, **Bo",
      "b** and **Charlie** each accumulate 40 tokens/second in the pool.\n- After 100 seconds, **Alice** can already see 2000 tokens on her balance. **Bob** and **Charlie** are each eligible to get 4000 tokens, but they cannot see them on their balance just yet.\n- **Bob** chooses to claim every 100 seconds, while **Charlie** chooses to connect to the pool.\n- **Bob** receives periodically 4000 tokens every 100 seconds.\n- By connecting to the pool, **Charlie** automatically claims the accumulated tokens, but also starts receiving tokens in real time.\n\n\n## Important Functions\n\nHere are some of the most important functions for interacting with Superfluid pools:\n\n:::note Reminder\nSome of this functions are available via [`SuperTokenV1Library.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library) (contracts using that lib) only.\n:::\n\n### createPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(ISuperToken token, address admin, PoolConfig memory poolConfig)\n```\n\nCreates a new pool with the specified admin, configur",
      "ation and poolConfig.\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n:::warning Strong recommendation\nWe don't recommend setting `transferabilityForUnitsOwner` to `true` unless you have a specific use case that absolutely requires it. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.\n:::\n\nSuperTokenV1Library also provides overloaded variants setting default values for `admin` (default: `msg.sender`) and/or `poolConfig` (default: `{ transferabilityForUnitsOwner: false, distributionFromAnyAddress: true }`).\n\n### updateMemberUnits\n\nThis function is p",
      "art of `ISuperfluidPool`, can thus be invoked on pool contracts.\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateMemberUnits(address memberAddress, uint128 newUnits)\n```\n\nUpdates the number of units a member has within a pool, effectively changing their share of future distributions.\n\n:::warning Important\nKeep in mind that the total amount of units in the pool needs to be significantly lower than the total flow rate or the total tokens distributed of the pool.\nTo understand more why this is the case, please refer to the [Member Units](#about-member-units) section.\n:::\n\n### claimAll\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, address memberAddress)\n```\n\nAllows a member to claim their share of the tokens from all previous distributions.\n\n### connectPool\n\n```solidity\nfunction connectPool(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\nConnects a pool member to a pool.\n\n:::tip About pool connections\nThe pool member needs to connect to a pool before the distribution balance is reflect",

      "ntract MyPool {\n    Using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n    \n    ISuperToken private superToken;\n    ISuperfluidPool private pool;\n    \n    constructor(ISuperToken _superToken) {\n        superToken = _superToken;\n        // create a pool with default settings:\n        // msg.sender is admin, non-transferrable units, anybody can distribute to it\n        pool = superToken.createPool();\n    }\n\n    // Use updateMemberUnits to assign units to a member.\n    // (This will typically be a permissioned operation, it's akin to minting tokens)\n    function updateMemberUnits(address member, uint128 units) public {\n        pool.updateMemberUnits(member, units);\n    }\n\n    // Instant distribution of tokens to pool members proportional to their current units\n    function distribute(uint256 amount) public {\n        superToken.distribute(pool, amount);\n    }\n\n    // Flow distribution of tokens to pool members proportional to their current units\n    function distributeFlow(int96 flowRate) public {",
      "\n        superToken.distributeFlow(pool, flowRate);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyPool` creates a pool, adds a member, and makes an Instant Distribution (discreet transfer - through `distribute`) and a Streaming Distribution (continuous flow - through `distributeFlow`) using the functions from `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`.\n\n:::info Learn more about the `SuperTokenV1Library`\nFor more detailed information on the implementation and usage of `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`, refer to the [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n",

In this case, you do not need to deploy a new instance of the Superfluid protocol.\nHowever, if you are testing on a local testnet you would need to deploy a new instance of the Superfluid protocol.\n\n<Tabs\n    defaultValue=\"testnet\"\n    values={[\n        { label: 'Forking Testnet', value: 'testnet' },\n        { label: 'Local Net', value: 'localnet' },\n    ]}\n>\n\n<TabItem v",

It is a special function that is executed before each test case. It is used to initialize the te',
      "st environment and contract instances.\nTo learn more about the `setUp` function, check out the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests).\n:::\n\n### Testing Contract Functions\n\n#### GainDaiX Function\n\nThe `gainDaiX` function mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx. Here's how to test it:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testGainDaiX() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract with a mock fDAIx token\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n\n    // Action: Call the gainDaiX function\n    distributionContract.gainDaiX();\n\n    // Assertions: Check if the contract has the expected amount of fDAIx\n    uint256 balance = daix.balanceOf(address(distributionContract));\n    assertEq(balance, 10000e18, \"The balance of fDAIx should be 10,000 after gainDaiX\");\n}\n```\n\n#### CreatePool Function\n\nTo test `createPool`, you'll verify if a pool is created with the correct parameters:\n\n```solidity\nfunct",
      "ion testCreatePool() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract and mock tokens\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n\n    // Define pool configuration\n    PoolConfig memory poolConfig;\n    // Set poolConfig parameters...\n\n    // Action: Call the createPool function\n    distributionContract.createPool(daix, poolConfig);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify if the pool is created correctly\n    ISuperfluidPool pool = distributionContract.pool();\n    // Additional assertions about pool...\n}\n```\n\n#### UpdateMemberUnits Function\n\nTesting `updateMemberUnits` involves checking if member units in a pool are updated correctly:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testUpdateMemberUnits() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract, create a pool, and add members\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n    // Create pool...\n    a",
      "ddress memberAddress = address(new Member());\n\n    // Action: Update member units\n    uint128 newUnits = 100;\n    distributionContract.updateMemberUnits(memberAddress, newUnits);\n\n    // Assertions: Check if the member's units are updated\n    uint128 updatedUnits = daix.getMemberUnits(memberAddress);\n    assertEq(updatedUnits, newUnits, \"Member units should be updated to the new value\");\n}\n```\n\n#### CreateStreamToPool Function\n\nFor `createStreamToPool`, you'll need to ensure that a stream is correctly established:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testCreateStreamToPool() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract and create a pool\n    ISuperToken daix = new MockSuperToken();\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(daix);\n    // Create pool...\n\n    // Action: Create a stream to the pool\n    int96 flowRate = 1000;\n    distributionContract.createStreamToPool(flowRate);\n\n    // Assertions: Verify the stream is created with the correct flow rate\n    // Impl",
      "ement checks for stream creation...\n}\n```\n\n### Using Cheat Codes\n\nFoundry's cheat codes can simulate various scenarios. Here's an example of using a cheat code to test access control:\n\n```solidity\nfunction testUnauthorizedAccess() public {\n    // Setup: Deploy the DistributionContract\n    DistributionContract distributionContract = new DistributionContract(...);\n\n    // Use cheat codes to simulate an unauthorized user\n    vm.prank(address(0x123));\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Unauthorized access\");\n\n    // Attempt to call a function that requires specific permissions\n    distributionContract.someFunctionRequiringAuthorization();\n}\n\n## Running Tests\n\nExecute your tests using the following command:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* Write clear, descriptive test cases.\n* Maintain code readability.\n* Use Foundry cheat codes for simulating real-world scenarios.\n* Aim for high test coverage.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting ensures the reliability and security of blockchain contracts.

Traditional models often involve complex, non-transparent payment structures and lack real-time interaction capabilities.

Let's dive into the key components and functionalities of this smart contract.\n\n### Contract Overview\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use the Superfluid Protocol's [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx) (also known as the GDA in our codebase) to develop a decentralized application (DApp) for advertisement auctioning. We'll walk through the key components of the `AdSpotContract`.\n\n## Contract Initialization\n\nThe `AdSpotContract` is initialized with necessary Superfluid interfaces and parameters. Here's a look at the constructor:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor(ISuperToken _acceptedToken)\n    CFASuperAppBase(ISuperfluid(_acceptedToken.getHost()))\n{\n    // Contract initialization code\n}\n```\n\nThis constructor sets up the Superfluid context and initializes the fund distribution pool.\n\n## Real-Time Auctioning Logic\n\nThe contract employs callback functions to manage auction logic. Here's an example of a callback function handling new flow",
      " creation:\n\n```solidity\nfunction onFlowCreated(\n    ISuperToken /*superToken*/,\n    address sender,\n    bytes calldata ctx\n) internal override returns (bytes memory newCtx) {\n    // Logic for handling new flow creation\n}\n```\n\nThese functions are crucial for updating the highest bidder and managing the distribution of shares.\n\n## NFT Showcase Feature\n\nThe contract also includes a feature for the highest bidder to showcase an NFT:\n\n```solidity\nfunction setNftToShowcase(address _nftAddress, uint256 _tokenId) external {\n    // NFT showcase logic\n}\n```\n\nThis feature adds interactivity to the advertisement space, allowing for dynamic content display.\n\n## Getters for Contract State\n\nVarious getter functions provide important information about the contract's state:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getHighestBidder() public view returns (address) {\n    // Logic to retrieve the highest bidder\n}\n```\n\nThese functions are essential for users to interact with and understand the contract's current state.\n\n<Admo",

      "rewards\n- Creating and managing a Superfluid pool for reward distribution\n- Handling the unstaking process\n- Facilitating reward claims\n\nKey components:\n\n- `underlyingStakedToken`: The ERC20 token that users stake\n- `underlyingRewardsToken`: The ERC20 token used for rewards\n- `superToken`: The Super Token wrapper for the rewards token\n- `pool`: The Superfluid pool used for distributing rewards\n- `scalingFactor`: A factor used to scale down staked amounts for precision\n\n### ClaimContract\n\nThis contract is created for each staker and is responsible for:\n\n- Claiming rewards from the Superfluid pool\n- Holding claimed rewards until withdrawn by the staker\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\nTo set up the development environment and run the tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Foundry**\n\n   Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development. To install Foundry, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\n   ```\n\n",

This splitting is determined by the `sideReceiverPortion` parameter, which defines the percentage of the incoming flow to be routed to the side receiver, with the remainder going to the main receiver.\n\n## Contract Overview\n\n<img src="/assets/diagram.png" alt="FlowSplitter Diagram"/>\n\n\nThe above diagram illustrates how the `FlowSplitter` works. For example, if the `sideReceiverPortion` is set to 30%, then 30% of all incoming Super Token streams will be routed to the side receiver, and the remaining 70% will go to the main receiver.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary',

      "\n\nTo deploy the `FlowSplitter`, you must specify the following parameters:\n\n- `host_`: The Superfluid host contract.\n- `acceptedSuperToken_`: The Super Token to be accepted by the contract.\n- `creator_`: The address of the account deploying the contract.\n- `mainReceiver_`: The address of the main receiver.\n- `sideReceiver_`: The address of the side receiver.\n- `sideReceiverPortion_`: The initial portion of the inflow to be directed to the side receiver.\n\n### Updating the Flow Split\n\nThe creator of the contract can update the flow split by calling the `updateSplit` function with a new `sideReceiverPortion_`. This adjusts the outflow rates to both receivers accordingly.\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateSplit(int96 newSideReceiverPortion_) external;\n```\n\n### Calculating Flow Rates\n\nTo calculate the exact outflow rates for the main and side receivers based on any inflow rate and `sideReceiverPortion`, use the `getMainAndSideReceiverFlowRates` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getMainAndSideReceiv",
      "erFlowRates(\n    int96 flowRate_,\n    int96 sideReceiverPortion_\n) external pure returns (\n    int96 mainFlowRate,\n    int96 sideFlowRate,\n    int96 residualFlowRate\n);\n```\n\n### Handling Streams\n\nThe contract includes several internal callback functions that handle the creation, updating, and deletion of streams:\n\n* `onFlowCreated`: Called when a new inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is created.\n* `onFlowUpdated`: Called when an existing inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is updated.\n* `onFlowDeleted`: Called when an inflow to the `FlowSplitter` is deleted.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `FlowSplitter` smart contract offers a robust solution for automatically splitting incoming Super Token streams. By setting the `sideReceiverPortion`, users can determine the flow rates to different parties, enabling a fair and transparent distribution of funds.\n",

Include the `using` statement:\n   ```solidity\n   using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n   ```\n\n:::tip Learn more about the SuperTokenV1Library\nFor more details on the SuperTokenV1Library, refer to the page [Using the SuperTokenV1Library](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/using-library). For a full list of its functions, refer to its [technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## Access Control in Superfluid\n\nAccess control is a crucial aspect of smart contract security, allowing certain addresses to perform specific actions.\nIn the context of Superfluid and money streaming, Access Control Lists (ACLs) enables one address (the Flow Operator) to manage streams on behalf of another address.\n\n### How Access Control Works in Superfluid\n\nSuperfluid implements a flexible permission system for flow management:\n\n1. **Granting Permissions**: An acco',
      "unt can grant permissions to a flow operator, specifying what actions they can perform (create, update, delete flows) and setting a flow rate allowance.\n\n2. **Flow Rate Allowance**: This is the maximum net flow rate that the operator can create on behalf of the account.\n\n3. **Operator Actions**: Once granted permissions, the operator can perform the allowed actions within the specified flow rate allowance.\n\n:::tip Access Control for [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview)\nIn this document, we address Access Control for Money Streaming (CFA). Currently, there are no access control functions for [Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview). However, you can build your own access control system using the SuperTokenV1Library functions.\n:::\n\n### Key Functions for Access Control\n\n1. `setFlowPermissions`: Set specific permissions for a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator,\n    bool allowCrea",
      "te,\n    bool allowUpdate,\n    bool allowDelete,\n    int96 flowRateAllowance\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n2. `flowFrom`: Control a flow as an operator on behalf of another account.\n\n```solidity\nfunction flowFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n3. `revokeFlowPermissions`: Revoke all permissions from a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction revokeFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\n:::tip Full list of functions\nFor a full list of functions related to access control, refer to the [SuperTokenV1Library technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library).\n:::\n\n## User Data in Superfluid\n\nUser data in Superfluid allows developers to attach additional information to transactions. This can be used for various purposes, such as including metadata, triggering specific logic in receiver contracts, or implementing off-chain systems.\n\n### How ",
      'to Use User Data\n\nMany functions in the SuperTokenV1Library accept a `userData` parameter. This is typically a `bytes` type, allowing you to encode any data you want to include.\n\nExample of using user data when controlling a flow:\n\n```solidity\nfunction flowFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    bytes memory userData\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nYou can encode various types of data into the `userData` parameter. For example:\n\n```solidity\nbytes memory userData = abi.encode(uint256(1234), "Hello, Superfluid!");\ncreateFlowWithUserData(token, receiver, flowRate, userData);\n```\n\n## Example: Granting Permissions and Creating a Flow\n\nHere\'s a simple example demonstrating how one contract can grant permissions to another, allowing it to create a flow on its behalf:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/sup',
      'erfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";\nimport { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";\n\ncontract PermissionGranter {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    function grantPermissions(\n        ISuperToken token,\n        address operator,\n        int96 flowRateAllowance\n    ) external {\n        token.setFlowPermissions(\n            operator,\n            true, // allowCreate\n            false, // allowUpdate\n            false, // allowDelete\n            flowRateAllowance\n        );\n    }\n}\n\ncontract FlowCreator {\n    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;\n\n    function createFlowAsOperator(\n        ISuperToken token,\n        address sender,\n        address receiver,\n        int96 flowRate\n    ) external {\n        token.flowFrom(sender, receiver, flowRate);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `PermissionGranter` can grant permissions to `FlowCreator`. Once permissions are granted, `FlowCreator` can create flows on behalf of ',
      "the address that called `grantPermissions`.\n\nTo use these contracts:\n\n1. Deploy both contracts.\n2. Call `grantPermissions` on `PermissionGranter`, passing the token address, the address of the `FlowCreator` contract, and the desired flow rate allowance.\n3. Now, anyone can call `createFlowAsOperator` on `FlowCreator`, which will create a flow from the address that granted permissions to the specified receiver.\n\nThis setup allows for flexible delegation of flow creation, which can be useful in various DeFi applications, automated systems, or multi-sig wallet scenarios.",

We\'ll use the `FlowSender` contract described in the [Quickstart](/docs/protocol/quickstart.mdx) as our example to demonstrate how to write effective tests.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving into testing your Superfluid contracts with Foundry, make sure you have set up your development environment properly. Here\'s a brief explanation of each step required:\n\n1. **Creating and Navigating to Your Project Directory**:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir superfluid-example && cd superfluid-example\n   ```\n\n   This command creates a new directory named `foundry-example` and then changes your current working directory to it.\n\n2. **Initializing a Foundry Project**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge init\n   ```\n\n   This initializes a new Foundry project in your directory, setting up the necessary structure an',
      'd configuration for Ethereum smart contract development.\n\n3. **Installing Superfluid Protocol Dependencies**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install superfluid-protocol-monorepo=https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the `dev` branch of the Superfluid protocol from its GitHub repository.\n\n4. **Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts**:\n\n   ```bash\n   forge install https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.9.6 --no-commit\n   ```\n\n   Installs the necessary (4.9.X) of the OpenZeppelin contracts, which are widely used for secure smart contract development.\n\nThese steps ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed to start developing and testing your Superfluid-based contracts with Foundry.\n\n## Contract and Key Functions\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show `FlowSender` contract</summary>\n<p>\n\n```solidity\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicensed\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\n\nimport { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superf',

This page provides an in-depth overview of Money Streaming and the unique aspects of Flow NFTs in the Superfluid ecosystem.\n\n## What is Money Streaming?\n\nMoney Streaming allows for continuous, per-second token transfers between accounts, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to token distribution.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Perpetual Transfers**: Streams continue until canceled by the sender or the sender's balance depletes.\n- **Flexible Management**: Streams can be created, updated, or deleted at any time by the sender.\n\nFor a more conceptual breakdown, refer to the [detailed Money Streaming overview](/docs/protocol/money-str",
      'eaming/overview.mdx).\n\n## Flows and Flow Rates\n\nMoney Streaming in Superfluid introduces the concepts of flows and flow rates, key elements for managing the continuous movement of tokens. This section defines these concepts and explains how to calculate flow rates accurately.\n\nFlows in Superfluid represent the continuous, per-second movement of tokens between accounts. They are defined by their flow rate and can be dynamically managed by the sender.\n\n:::tip\n\nYou may have a hard time seeing the difference between "Flows" and "Streams". This is a feature, not a bug. The key difference is the following: Flows can be equal to 0, while Streams need to be strictly positive.\n\n:::\n\nFlows have the following Characteristics:\n\n- **Perpetual**: Flows continue until the sender decides to cancel or the balance depletes.\n- **Flexible**: Flows can be created, updated, or stopped at any time.\n\n### Calculating Flow Rates\n\n\nFlow rates dictate the speed at which tokens are transferred per second. Superflu',
      'id requires these rates to be specified in wei per second.\n\nIt\'s crucial to translate your desired flow rate into wei per second accurately. Incorrect calculations can lead to discrepancies between expected and actual flow rates as displayed on the Superfluid Dashboard and Explorer.\n\n<Admonition type="info" title="Flow Rate Conversion">\n\nFlow rates can be reframed from larger time denominations like months or years into wei per second. Understand the conversion process to accurately determine the wei/second rate for your flows.\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Calculation Examples\n\n#### From Month to Wei/Second\n\n- **Monthly Rate**: 10 DAIx/month.\n- **Calculation**: 10 DAIx / ((365/12) * 24 * 60 * 60) = 3805175038052 wei/second.\n\n#### From Year to Wei/Second\n\n- **Yearly Rate**: 100 DAIx/year.\n- **Calculation**: 100 DAIx / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 3170979198376 wei/second.\n\n<Admonition type="warning" title="Calculation Precision">\n\nUsing an approximate number of days in a month (like 30 days) for calcu',
      "lations can lead to slightly inaccurate wei/second rates, affecting how the rate appears on Superfluid interfaces.\n\n</Admonition>\n\nThis section provides a clear understanding of flows and flow rates within the Superfluid Money Streaming, enabling users to accurately manage and interpret their token streams.",

      "installed on your system\n- Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contract development\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, let's clone the Custom Super Tokens repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/custom-supertokens\ncd custom-supertokens\n```\n\nThis repository is structured as a Foundry project and contains multiple examples of custom Super Tokens.\n\nOnce you've cloned the repository, install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\nforge install\n```\n\nThis command will install the required packages, including `@superfluid-finance`, `@openzeppelin-contracts (v4.9.3)`, and `forge-std`.\n\n## Example 1: Pure Super Token\n\nLet's start with the Pure Super Token example. This is a simple custom Super Token implementation.\n\n### Understanding the Contract\n\nThe `PureSuperToken.sol` file contains the contract for our Pure Super Token:\n\n```solidity\ncontract PureSuperTokenProxy is CustomSuperTokenBase, UUPSProxy {\n    function initialize(\n        ISuperTokenFactory factory,\n        string memory",
      ' name,\n        string memory symbol,\n        address receiver,\n        uint256 initialSupply\n    ) external {\n        ISuperTokenFactory(factory).initializeCustomSuperToken(address(this));\n        ISuperToken(address(this)).initialize(\n            IERC20(address(0)),\n            18,\n            name,\n            symbol\n        );\n        ISuperToken(address(this)).selfMint(receiver, initialSupply, "");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract creates a new `UUPSProxy` which is initialized as a Pure Super Token. The `initialize` function sets up the token using the `SuperTokenFactory` and mints the initial supply to the specified receiver.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test the Pure Super Token, run:\n\n```bash\nforge test --match testDeploy testSuperTokenBalance\n```\n\nThis will execute the tests in `PureSuperToken.t.sol`, which include deploying the token and checking the receiver\'s balance.\n\n### Deployment\n\nTo deploy the Pure Super Token, use the following Foundry command:\n\n```bash\nforge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> ',
      '--private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --etherscan-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --verify --via-ir src/PureSuperToken.sol:PureSuperTokenProxy\n```\n\nReplace `<RPC_URL>`, `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>`, and `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual values.\n\n### Initialization\n\nAfter deployment, you need to initialize the token by calling the `initialize` function with the appropriate parameters:\n\n```solidity\npureSuperToken.initialize(\n    superTokenFactory,\n    "MyToken",\n    "MTK",\n    initialReceiver,\n    initialSupply\n);\n```\n\n## Example 2: Bridged Super Token\n\nThe Bridged Super Token is a more complex example that includes additional functionality for cross-chain operations.\n\n### Understanding the Contract\n\nThe `BridgedSuperToken.sol` file contains the contract for our Bridged Super Token. This implementation includes features like minting and burning limits for bridges.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test the Bridged Super Token, run:\n\n```bash\nforge test\n```\n\nThis will execute the tests in `BridgedSuperTokenTest.t.sol`, which co',
      "ver various aspects of the token's functionality, including limit setting, minting, and burning.\n\n### Deployment and Initialization\n\nThe deployment and initialization process for the Bridged Super Token is similar to the Pure Super Token. Use the `forge create` command for deployment, and then call the `initialize` function to set up the token.\n\n## Creating Your Own Custom Super Token\n\nWhen creating your own custom Super Token, you can use the following functions from the [ISuperToken Interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken)\n\n### `selfMint`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfMint(\n    address account,\n    uint256 amount,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function mints new tokens for the specified account. If `userData` is not empty, it invokes the `tokensReceived` hook according to ERC777 semantics.\n\n### `selfBurn`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfBurn(\n    address account,\n    uint256 amount,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function burns existing tokens for th",
      "e specified account. If `userData` is not empty, it invokes the `tokensToSend` hook according to ERC777 semantics.\n\n### `selfTransferFrom`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfTransferFrom(\n    address sender,\n    address spender,\n    address recipient,\n    uint256 amount\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function transfers tokens from the `sender` to the `recipient`. If `spender` isn't the same as `sender`, it checks if `spender` has allowance to spend tokens of `sender`.\n\n### `selfApproveFor`\n\n```solidity\nfunction selfApproveFor(\n    address account,\n    address spender,\n    uint256 amount\n) external;\n```\n\nThis function gives `spender` the `amount` allowance to spend the tokens of `account`.\n\nThese functions allow you to customize the behavior of your Super Token while maintaining compatibility with the Superfluid protocol.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following this guide, you should now be able to deploy and initialize custom Super Tokens for the Superfluid protocol. Remember to thoroughly test your custom impleme",
      "ntations and consider the security implications of any additional functionality you add to your tokens.\n\nFor more information on Custom Super Tokens, check out the [Custom Super Token Wiki](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/About-Custom-Super-Token) and the [Deploy a Custom Super Token Guide](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-custom-super-token).",

      "nction createPool(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    address admin,\n    struct PoolConfig poolConfig\n) \n    internal \n    returns (contract ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n#### Claiming tokens\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(\n    contract ISuperToken token,\n    contract ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress\n) \n    internal \n    returns (bool)\n```\nThis function allows a member to claim all tokens to all the members of the pool.\n\n\n### Access Control Functions\n\nThe library also provides functions for managing access",
      " control and permissions between different wallet addresses and smart contracts:\n\n#### Setting Flow Permissions\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator,\n    bool allowCreate,\n    bool allowUpdate,\n    bool allowDelete,\n    int96 flowRateAllowance\n) internal returns (bool)\n```\n\nThis function allows you to grant specific permissions to another address (flowOperator) to manage flows on your behalf.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Context-Aware Functions\n\nFor more advanced use cases including with [Super Apps](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/super-apps/understand-super-apps), the library provides context-aware versions of many functions. These are useful when you need to chain multiple operations or when working within the context of a Superfluid callback:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createFlowFromWithCtx(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowRate,\n    bytes memory ctx\n) internal returns (bytes memory newCtx)\n```\n",
      "\n### User Data\n\nMany functions in the SuperTokenV1Library allow you to attach user data to your transactions. This can be useful for adding metadata or triggering specific logic in receiver contracts.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Always check return values of functions to ensure operations were successful.\n2. Be mindful of gas costs, especially when working with multiple flows or large distribution pools.\n3. Use the appropriate permissions and access control functions to ensure the security of your contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SuperTokenV1Library is a powerful tool for interacting with the Superfluid protocol on-chain, in order to build smart contracts. By leveraging its functions for money streaming and distribution pools, you can create sophisticated blockchain applications with real-time finance capabilities. Always refer to the latest documentation and test thoroughly to ensure your implementation is correct and secure.",

Super Tokens exist in two primary forms: Wrapper and Pure.\n\n\n\n## Real-Time Balance\n\nSuper Tokens revolutionize balance calculations by combining traditional static balances with dynamic, real-time adjustments based on streams and distributions, leading to a more fluid representation of an account's value.\n\nCharacteristics of Super Tokens:\n\n* **Static Balance**: Reflects the conventional ERC20 balance, representing the basic, unchanging part of an account's value.\n* **Real-Time Balances**: Incorporates fluctuations from streams and distributions, adjusting the balance with each block to reflect ongoing financial activities. When you call the method `balanceOf()` on",
      " a Super Token, you get a real-time balance.\n* **Complex Calculation**: Unlike conventional tokens, `balanceOf()` method in Super Tokens doesn't just retrieve a stored value; it performs complex calculations based on numerous parameters to give the real time balance.\n* **Ongoing Relationships**: These calculations consider the account's continuous relationships with others, making the balance more representative of the current financial state.\n* **Time-Sensitive**: In cases involving streams, the balance is further influenced by time, specifically through the timestamp of the latest block, making it sensitive to the passage of time.\n* **Dynamic Adjustment**: As a result, the balance is a \"real-time balance,\" capable of changing with every new block, independent of direct transactions affecting the account.\n\n## Types of Super Tokens\n\n<Tabs\n  defaultValue=\"wrapper\"\n  values={[\n    {label: 'Wrapper Super Tokens', value: 'wrapper'},\n    {label: 'Pure Super Tokens', value: 'pure'},\n    {lab",

Wrapper Super Tokens\n\nWrapper Super Tokens are wrapped from existing ERC20 tokens to allow interaction with the Superfluid Protocol.\nThey are the most common currently and can be permissionlessly created for any ERC20 token.\n\n#### Wrapping & Unwrapping\n\n- **Wrapping**: Deposit ERC20 tokens into the Wrapper Super Token contract to mint an equivalent amount of Super Tokens.\n- **Unwrapping**: Burn Super Tokens to get back the underlying ERC20 tokens.\n\n\n#### When to use Custom Wrappers?\n\n- **Unconventional ERC-20**: Custom Wrapper Super Tokens are typically used when underlying ERC20 tokens have complex functionalities that standard wrappers can't handle.\n- **Additional Features**: They can also be used to add additional features to the Super Token which don't exist in the Super Token contract.\n\nFor detailed deployment steps and further information, visit the [Deploy a Super Token Page](/docs/protocol/su",

Pure Super Tokens\n\nPure Super Tokens are independent of any underlying asset, inheriting all Superfluid functionalities directly.\n\n#### Customization\n\nPure Super Tokens can be customized with additional features like pre-minting, access control, and wallet whitelisting. They can be categorized as Governed or Independent, with Governed Pure Super Tokens recommended for alignment with Superfluid Protocol Governance.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on deploying Pure Super Tokens, refer to the [Pure Super Token Deployment](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-pure-super-token.mdx) section.\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value="native">\n\n### 3.

      "thereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771). As opposed to the [EIP-4337](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction)\nwhich uses a Contract Account (CA) for abstraction, ERC-2771\nextends the capabilities of the Host by allowing a trusted forwarder to pass the original `msg.sender` to the host contract through the method `forwardBatchCall`.\n\n\n## Macro Forwarder Contract Overview\n\nIntroducing a simple and secure way for builders to define their own macros without needing to be directly trusted by the Superfluid host contract.\nThis approach simplifies on-chain logic for batch calls, reduces gas consumption and potentially ameliorates the front-end code, addressing atomicity issues.\nToday, Superfluid has a contract called [`MacroForwarder.sol`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/utils/MacroForwarder.sol)\n which is a trusted forwarder for user-defined macro interfaces.\n\n<div>\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to show the `MacroForwarde",

      'olidity">{MultiFlowDeleteMacro}</CodeBlock>\n</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n\nThe steps in order to use the `MacroForwarder` contract are as follows:\n1. Create a contract which inherit the User Defined Macro Interface\n2. Implement your Macro Interface\n3. Use the Macro Forwarder to batch call the transactions\n\n:::tip Get ready for tests and deployment\nCreating your own macro involves testing and deploying a smart contract. If you are not familiar with testing and deployment frameworks on the Ethereum Virtual Machine,\nyou should consider learning about [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).\n:::\n\n\n### 1. Create your contract and inherit the User Defined Macro Interface\n\nAs you may have noticed, the `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` contract inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface like so:\n\n```solidity\ncontract MultiFlowDeleteMacro is IUserDefinedMacro {\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis is an interface that defines the `buildBatchOperations` method. It is the only required method to be',
      " implemented in the contract that inherits it.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to create a new contract which inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\n\n### 2. Implement your Macro Interface\n\nThe `buildBatchOperations` method is the only required method to be implemented in the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\nThis method returns an array of `ISuperfluid.Operation[]` struct which will be consumed by the `MacroForwarder` contract. This struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct Operation {\n    operationType operationType;\n    address target;\n    bytes data;\n}\n```\n\nIn the example contract `MultiFlowDeleteMacro`, you can see that the `buildBatchOperations` method is implemented as follows:\n\n```solidity\nfunction buildBatchOperations(ISuperfluid host, bytes memory params, address msgSender) public virtual view\n        returns (ISuperfluid.Operation[] memory operations)\n    {\n        IConstantFlowAgreementV1 cfa = IConstantFlowAgreementV1(address(host.getAgree",
      'mentClass(\n            keccak256("org.superfluid-finance.agreements.ConstantFlowAgreement.v1")\n        )));\n\n        // parse params\n        (ISuperToken token, address[] memory receivers) =\n            abi.decode(params, (ISuperToken, address[]));\n\n        // construct batch operations\n        operations = new ISuperfluid.Operation[](receivers.length);\n        for (uint i = 0; i < receivers.length; ++i) {\n            bytes memory callData = abi.encodeCall(cfa.deleteFlow,\n                                                   (token,\n                                                    msgSender,\n                                                    receivers[i],\n                                                    new bytes(0) // placeholder\n                                                   ));\n            operations[i] = ISuperfluid.Operation({\n                operationType : BatchOperation.OPERATION_TYPE_SUPERFLUID_CALL_AGREEMENT, // type\n                target: address(cfa),\n             ',
      "   data: abi.encode(callData, new bytes(0))\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\n\n:::warning About the method `getParams`\nThe `MultiFlowDeleteMacro` example contract contains a method called `getParams`. This method is not required to be implemented in the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface.\nHowever, it is highly recommended to implement this method in order to parse the parameters of the macro on the front-end.\n\nThis method is simply implemented by encoding the parameters that will be used to call the method `runMacro`from `MacroForwarder` contract. It is usually one line of code as such:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getParams(ISuperToken token, address[] memory receivers) public pure returns (bytes memory) {\n    return abi.encode(token, receivers);\n}\n```\n:::\n\nOnce, you set up and tested your Macro contract, you can deploy it to your target EVM network and use the `MacroForwarder` contract to batch call the transactions.\n\n### 3. Use the Macro Forwarder to batch call th",
      "e transactions\n\nThe `MacroForwarder` contract is used to batch call the transactions. It is a simple contract that has a method called `runMacro` which takes the following parameters:\n\n- `IUserDefinedMacro m`: The address of the contract that inherits the `IUserDefinedMacro` interface\n- `bytes calldata params`: The parameters of the macro\n\nThe `runMacro` method is called by the user and it will batch call the transactions defined in the `buildBatchOperations` method of the `IUserDefinedMacro` contract.\n\nTo showcase how this works, we use the [`MacroFowarder` contract](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xFD0268E33111565dE546af2675351A4b1587F89F) deployed on OP Sepolia.\nWe deployed an example of our [`MultiFlowDeleteMacro` contract](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x997b37Fb47c489CF067421aEeAf7Be0543fA5362) on the same network.\nWe will use the `MacroForwarder` contract to batch call the transactions.\n\nWe showcase below a simple React component which implements a",

We will specifically show how you can connect members to pools, and claim tokens from them.\n\n## Interacting with the Superfluid Protocol\n\nTo interact with Superfluid's distribution pools from client applications, you'll use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract. Here's how to set it up:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nThe `GDAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all Superfluid chains:\n\n```\n0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08\n```\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract in the [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n\n### Setting up with ethers.js\n\nHere's how to initiate interaction with the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract using",

      "eal for continuous, real-time token distribution.\n\n2. **Claiming from a Pool**:\n   - Claiming is the process of explicitly withdrawing accumulated tokens from the pool.\n   - Members can claim periodically to move tokens from the pool to their personal balance.\n   - This is useful for members who prefer to manually manage their token receipts or for specific accounting purposes.\n\nIn essence, connecting provides a passive, continuous flow of tokens, while claiming is an active process to withdraw accumulated tokens.\n\n## Interacting with the GDAv1Forwarder Contract\n\nLet's look at how to use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract to connect, disconnect, and claim from pools.\n\n### Connecting to a Pool\n\nTo connect a member to a pool, use the `connectPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction connectPool(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to connect.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javas",
      'cript\nconst connectPool = async (poolAddress, userData = "0x") => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.connectPool(poolAddress, userData);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Successfully connected to pool");\n    return receipt.status === 1; // 1 indicates success\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error connecting to pool:", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n:::tip Connecting triggers a claim\nWhen a member connects to a pool, the contract automatically claims all the previously available tokens for the member.\n:::\n\n### Disconnecting from a Pool\n\nTo disconnect a member from a pool, use the `disconnectPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction disconnectPool(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to disconnect.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst disconnectPool = async (poolAddress, userData = "0x") => {\n  try {\n    const tx =',
      ' await forwarderContract.disconnectPool(poolAddress, userData);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Successfully disconnected from pool");\n    return receipt.status === 1; // 1 indicates success\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error disconnecting from pool:", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Claiming All Tokens from a Pool\n\nTo claim all available tokens for a member from a pool, use the `claimAll` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction claimAll(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to claim from.\n- `memberAddress`: The address of the member to claim for.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst claimAll = async (poolAddress, memberAddress, userData = "0x") => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.claimAll(poolAddress, memberAddress, userData);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Successfully claimed all tokens ',
      "from pool\");\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error claiming tokens from pool:\", error);\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Pool Interaction\n\nHere's an example of a UI component for connecting, disconnecting, and claiming from Superfluid pools:\n\n```jsx live\n\nfunction PoolInteractionManager() {\n  const [poolAddress, setPoolAddress] = useState('');\n  const [memberAddress, setMemberAddress] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n\n  const forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n  const forwarderABI = GDAv1ForwarderABI; // You will need to import the ABI in your code.

Here's ho",
      "w to set it up:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nThe `GDAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all Superfluid chains:\n\n```\n0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08\n```\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract in the [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n\n### Setting up with ethers.js\n\nHere's how to initiate interaction with the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the GDAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n\n// The ABI of the GDAv1Forwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSig",
      "ner());\n```\n\n## Understanding Distribution Pools\n\nDistributions is a Superfluid primitive that allows scalable one-to-many or many-to-many transfer of value, in the form of discrete transfers or Money Streaming. Superfluid's implementation of this concept allows for the creation of **Pools** with a designated **pool admin** who manages **units** for **pool members**.\n\nKey concepts:\n- **Pool**: A mechanism for distributing tokens among multiple recipients.\n- **Pool Admin**: The address that has control over the pool's configuration and member units.\n- **Units**: A measure of a member's share in the pool's distributions.\n- **Pool Members**: Addresses that receive distributions from the pool based on their units.\n\n## Interacting with the GDAv1Forwarder Contract\n\nLet's look at how to use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract to create and manage distribution pools.\n\n### Creating a Pool\n\nTo create a new Superfluid Pool, use the `createPool` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createPool(\n    ISuperflui",
      "dToken token,\n    address admin,\n    PoolConfig memory config\n) external returns (bool success, ISuperfluidPool pool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address.\n- `admin`: The pool admin address.\n- `config`: The pool configuration (see below).\n\nThe `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:\n\n```solidity\nstruct PoolConfig {\n    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;\n    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;\n}\n```\n- `transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members\n- `distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool\n\n:::warning Strong recommendation\nWe don't recommend setting `transferabilityForUnitsOwner` to `true` unless you have a specific use case that absolutely requires it. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.\n:::\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```java",
      'script\nconst createPool = async (tokenAddress, adminAddress, config) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.createPool(tokenAddress, adminAddress, config);\n    const receipt = await tx.wait();\n    const [success, poolAddress] = receipt.events.find(e => e.event === \'PoolCreated\').args;\n    console.log("Pool created successfully:", poolAddress);\n    return poolAddress;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error creating pool:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Updating Member Units\n\nTo update the units of a pool member, use the `updateMemberUnits` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateMemberUnits(\n    ISuperfluidPool pool,\n    address memberAddress,\n    uint128 newUnits,\n    bytes memory userData\n) external\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `pool`: The Superfluid Pool to update.\n- `memberAddress`: The address of the member to update.\n- `newUnits`: The new units of the member.\n- `userData`: User-specific data.\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst updateMemberUnits = async (poolAddress, mem',
      "berAddress, newUnits, userData) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.updateMemberUnits(poolAddress, memberAddress, newUnits, userData);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log(\"Member units updated successfully!\");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error updating member units:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Distribution Pool Management\n\nHere's an example of a UI component for creating and managing distribution pools:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction DistributionPoolManager() {\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [adminAddress, setAdminAddress] = useState('');\n  const [poolAddress, setPoolAddress] = useState('');\n  const [memberAddress, setMemberAddress] = useState('');\n  const [newUnits, setNewUnits] = useState('');\n  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const toast = useToast();\n\n  const forwarderAddress = '0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08';\n  const forwa",

Think of entities as analogous to database tables. Here\'s a brief overview:\n\n### Event Entities\n\nEvent entities correspond to contract events, often with added data. Each event entity is immutable and created once.\n\n- **Eve',
      "nt ID Format**: `eventName-transactionHash-logIndex`.\n- **Naming Convention**: For V1, event names end with 'Event'.\n\n### Higher Order Level Entities (HOL)\n\nHOL entities represent entities over their lifetime and may be updated.\n\n- **`Account`**: Represents any address interacting with Superfluid.\n- **`Token`**: Represents valid SuperTokens.\n- **`Pool`**, **`PoolMember`**, **`Stream`**, **`StreamPeriod`**: Related to Superfluid streams and [pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools.mdx).\n\n### Aggregate Entities\n\nAggregate entities store cumulative data at both account-token and global token levels:\n\n- **`TokenStatistic`**: Aggregates data for a single Token type.\n- **`AccountTokenSnapshot`**: Aggregates data on an account's interaction with a token.\n\n## Query Examples\n\n### Super Token Data Query\n\n```javascript\n{\n  tokens(first: 100) {\n    id\n    symbol\n    name\n    underlyingAddress\n  }\n}\n```\n### Get the pools that a user is a member of\n\nTo list all pools that an account is curr",

Create a new Next.js project:\n```bash\nnpx",
      " create-next-app@latest rewards-distribution --typescript --tailwind\ncd rewards-distribution\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install ethers@6 @superfluid-finance/sdk-core\n```\n\n3. Install UI components:\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest init\n```\n\n## Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n### Superfluid Distribution Pools\n\n[Distribution Pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview) allow for proportional distribution of streaming tokens. Think of it as a smart contract that:\n- Manages a pool of tokens\n- Distributes streams based on units assigned to recipients\n- Handles all the complex token streaming logic\n\n:::tip\nTo deploy a Distribution Pool, you can use the [GDAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n### Superfluid Macros\n\n[Macros](/docs/sdk/advanced-topics/batch-calls) allow us to batch multiple operations into a single transaction. In our case, we're using:\n- `MacroForwarder`: Contract that executes our macro\n- [`RewardsMacro`](https://github.com/superfluid-fina",
      "nce/rewards-macro-example/blob/main/contracts/RewardsMacro.sol): Our custom macro for setting up distributions\n\nIn our example, we deployed a [`RewardsMacro`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/rewards-macro-example/blob/main/contracts/RewardsMacro.sol) contract on [OP Sepolia](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xA315e7EB0a278fac7B3a74DB895f5bf801EAb632?tab=contract) for the purposes of our example.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Network Management\n\nFirst, we need to ensure users are on the correct network:\n\n```typescript\nconst OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID = \"0xaa37dc\" // 11155420 in hex\n\nconst switchToOpSepolia = async () => {\n  try {\n    await window.ethereum.request({\n      method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',\n      params: [{ chainId: OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID }],\n    });\n    return true;\n  } catch (switchError) {\n    // Handle network switch error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Pool Validation\n\nWe validate the pool address and check user's balance:\n\n```typescript\nconst POOL_ABI = [\"function sup",
      'erToken() external view returns (ISuperfluidToken)"]\nconst SUPER_TOKEN_ABI = ["function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)"]\n\nconst checkPoolAndBalance = async () => {\n  const poolContract = new ethers.Contract(poolAddress, POOL_ABI, provider);\n  const tokenAddress = await poolContract.superToken();\n  const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, SUPER_TOKEN_ABI, provider);\n  const balance = await tokenContract.balanceOf(userAddress);\n  // Handle results\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Reward Distribution Setup\n\nThe core functionality uses the RewardsMacro contract:\n\n```typescript\nconst executeRewardsMacro = async () => {\n  // Parse recipients and units\n  const receivers = [...] // Array of addresses\n  const units = [...] // Array of BigInts\n  \n  // Convert flow rate from tokens/day to wei/second\n  const weiBigInt = ethers.parseEther(flowRatePerDay)\n  const flowRateWeiPerSecond = weiBigInt / BigInt(86400)\n  \n  // Get macro parameters\n  const params = await rewardsMacro.',
      "getParams(\n    poolAddress,\n    receivers,\n    units,\n    flowRateWeiPerSecond\n  )\n  \n  // Execute through MacroForwarder\n  await macroForwarder.runMacro(REWARDS_MACRO, params)\n}\n```\n\n## User Interface\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <img src=\"/img/example-ui.png\" alt=\"Example UI\" width=\"600\" />\n</div>\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n    <p>*Screenshot of the UI*</p>\n</div>\n\nThe UI is built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. Key features include:\n- Network status indicator\n- Pool validation feedback\n- Balance display\n- Recipients input area\n- Flow rate input with conversion\n\n```typescript\n<Card className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto bg-gray-800\">\n  <CardHeader>\n    <CardTitle>Reward Stream Distribution</CardTitle>\n  </CardHeader>\n  <CardContent>\n    {/* Network Check */}\n    {/* Pool Input */}\n    {/* Recipients Input */}\n    {/* Flow Rate Input */}\n    {/* Execute Button */}\n  </CardContent>\n</Card>\n```\n\n## Testing the Applic",
      "ation\n\n1. Deploy the contract and set up your pool\n   - Deploy the `RewardsMacro` contract on your desired network (you can use the contract deployed on [OP Sepolia](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xA315e7EB0a278fac7B3a74DB895f5bf801EAb632?tab=contract))\n   - Create your pool using the [GDAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder)\n   - Ensure you use the correct Super Token for your pool (in our example, we used the [Super fake DAI](https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0x7f5c765057ef45c28ae624f7b77854c32c201422?tab=contract) Super Token)\n\n2. Test the flow:\n   - Connect wallet\n   - Enter pool address\n   - Add recipients\n   - Set flow rate\n   - Execute distribution\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### Invalid Pool Address\n```typescript\ntry {\n  await poolContract.superToken()\n} catch (e) {\n  // Handle invalid pool\n}\n```\n\n### Insufficient Balance\n```typescript\nif (Number(userBalance) === 0) {\n  // Disable execution\n  // Show warning\n}\n```\n\n### Netwo",
      "rk Issues\n```typescript\nif (chainId !== OP_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID) {\n  await switchToOpSepolia()\n}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nConsider extending the application with:\n- Multiple network support\n- Distribution history\n- Analytics dashboard",

      "er` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the CFAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n\n// The ABI of the CFAv1Forwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSigner());\n```\n\n## Access Control in Superfluid\n\nAccess control in Superfluid allows one account (the flow operator) to manage flows on behalf of another account. This is particularly useful for automated systems, multi-sig wallets, or any scenario where you want to delegate flow management.\n\nKey concepts:\n- **Flow Operator**: An account that has been granted permissions to manage flows on behalf of another acc",
      "ount.\n- **Permissions**: The specific actions a flow operator is allowed to perform (create, update, delete flows).\n- **Flow Rate Allowance**: The maximum net flow rate a flow operator can create on behalf of the account.\n\n## User Data in Superfluid\n\nUser data in Superfluid allows you to attach additional information to transactions. This can be used for various purposes:\n- Including metadata with transactions\n- Triggering specific logic in receiver contracts\n- Implementing off-chain systems that react to on-chain events\n\nUser data is typically passed as a `bytes` parameter in Superfluid functions, allowing you to encode any type of data you need.\n\n## Key Functions for Access Control (with User Data)\n\n### grantPermissions\n\nGrants permissions to a flow operator to manage flows on behalf of the caller.\n\n```solidity\nfunction grantPermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `flowOperator`: ",
      'The account to which permissions are granted\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst grantPermissions = async (tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.grantPermissions(tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Permissions granted successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error granting permissions:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### revokePermissions\n\nRevokes all permissions previously granted to a flow operator.\n\n```solidity\nfunction revokePermissions(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address flowOperator\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `flowOperator`: The account from which permissions are revoked\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst revokePermissions = async (tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.revokePermissions(tokenAddress, flowOperatorAddress);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Permissions rev',
      'oked successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error revoking permissions:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### setFlowrateFrom\n\nAllows a flow operator to set the flow rate from one account to another.\n\n```solidity\nfunction setFlowrateFrom(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `token`: The Super Token address\n- `sender`: The sender of the flow\n- `receiver`: The receiver of the flow\n- `flowrate`: The desired flow rate in tokens per second (using 18 decimal places)\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nconst setFlowrateFrom = async (tokenAddress, senderAddress, receiverAddress, flowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.setFlowrateFrom(tokenAddress, senderAddress, receiverAddress, flowRate);\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Flow rate set successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error setting flow rate:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Live UI Example for Access C',

      ' small technicality which is not necessarily important to understand.\nHowever, in Superfluid, a "Flow" is a more general term than a "Stream".\nA Stream is a non-zero flow, while a zero flow is not considered a Stream.\n:::\n\n## How to interact with the Superfluid protocol from a client application?\nThere are mainly two ways to interact with the Superfluid protocol from a client application:\n- The [`CFAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) contract: This contract is used to create, update, and delete flows.\n- The [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder) contract: This contract is used to create and manage Distribution Pools.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, we will focus on the [`CFAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) contract which allows you to create, update, and delete flows.\n\n:::tip Where does the name CFAv1Forwarder come from?\nThe name `CFAv1Forwarder` is derived from the term "Constant Flow Agreement" (CFA) which is the unde',
      "rlying agreement that governs Money Streaming in Superfluid.\n:::\n\n## Interacting with the CFAv1Forwarder Contract\n\nTo interact with Money Streaming, you'll need to use the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract. Here's how to get started:\n\n### Contract ABI and Address\n\nYou can find the full ABI of the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract in the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n\nThe `CFAv1Forwarder` contract address is the same on all networks:\n\n```\n0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125\n```\n\n### Initiating Contract Interaction with ethers.js\n\nHere's an example of how to initiate interaction with the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract using ethers.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\n// Assuming you have a provider set up (e.g., using MetaMask)\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n\n// The address of the CFAv1Forwarder contract\nconst forwarderAddress = '0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125';\n\n// The ABI of the CFAv1F",
      "orwarder contract (import this from the technical reference)\nconst forwarderABI = [...]; // Insert the ABI here\n\n// Create a contract instance\nconst forwarderContract = new ethers.Contract(forwarderAddress, forwarderABI, provider.getSigner());\n```\n\nNow that we have our contract instance set up, let's look at how to create, update, and delete flows.\n\n## Creating a Flow\n\nTo create a new flow, you can use the `createFlow` function of the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction createFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `token`: The address of the Super Token you want to stream.\n- `sender`: The address that will be sending the tokens.\n- `receiver`: The address that will be receiving the tokens.\n- `flowrate`: The rate at which tokens will be streamed, in tokens per second (using 18 decimal places).\n- `userData`: (Optional) Additional data",
      ' to include with the transaction. Use "0x" if not needed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst createFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver, flowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.createFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      flowRate,\n      "0x" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Flow created successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error creating flow:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n:::tip using setFlowrate instead\nYou can also use the `setFlowrate` function to update the flow rate of an existing flow.\nFor a full list of functions available in the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n## Updating a Flow\n\nTo update an existing flow, use the `updateFlow` function.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction updateFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    ',
      'address receiver,\n    int96 flowrate,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe parameters are the same as for `createFlow`. The `flowrate` parameter specifies the new flow rate.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst updateFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver, newFlowRate) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.updateFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      newFlowRate,\n      "0x" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Flow updated successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error updating flow:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n:::tip using setFlowrate instead\nYou can also use the `setFlowrate` function to update the flow rate of an existing flow.\nFor a full list of functions available in the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n## Deleting a Flow\n\nTo stop a',
      'nd delete an existing flow, use the `deleteFlow` function.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```solidity\nfunction deleteFlow(\n    ISuperToken token,\n    address sender,\n    address receiver,\n    bytes userData\n) external returns (bool)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `token`: The address of the Super Token of the flow you want to delete.\n- `sender`: The address that is sending the tokens in the flow.\n- `receiver`: The address that is receiving the tokens in the flow.\n- `userData`: (Optional) Additional data to include with the transaction. Use "0x" if not needed.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst deleteFlow = async (tokenAddress, receiver) => {\n  try {\n    const tx = await forwarderContract.deleteFlow(\n      tokenAddress,\n      await provider.getSigner().getAddress(), // sender (current user)\n      receiver,\n      "0x" // no user data\n    );\n    await tx.wait();\n    console.log("Flow deleted successfully!");\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error("Error deleting flow:", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n:::tip u',

Think of entities as analogous to database tables. Here\'s a brief overview:\n\n### Event Entities\n\nEvent entities correspond to contract events, often with added data. Each event entity is immutable and created once',
      ".\n\n- **Event ID Format**: `eventName-transactionHash-logIndex`.\n- **Naming Convention**: For V1, event names end with 'Event'.\n\n### Higher Order Level Entities (HOL)\n\nHOL entities represent entities over their lifetime and may be updated.\n\n- **`Account`**: Represents any address interacting with Superfluid.\n- **`Token`**: Represents valid SuperTokens.\n- **`Pool`**, **`PoolMember`**, **`Stream`**, **`StreamPeriod`**: Related to Superfluid streams and [pools](/docs/protocol/distributions/guides/pools).\n\n### Aggregate Entities\n\nAggregate entities store cumulative data at both account-token and global token levels:\n\n- **`TokenStatistic`**: Aggregates data for a single Token type.\n- **`AccountTokenSnapshot`**: Aggregates data on an account's interaction with a token.\n\n## Query Examples\n\nHere are examples to help you get started with Superfluid subgraphs:\n\n### Super Token Data Query\n\n```javascript\n{\n  tokens(first: 100) {\n    id\n    symbol\n    name\n    underlyingAddress\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Get Al",

      "---\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\n# Quickstart\n\nThis guide will help you get started with the Superfluid protocol by creating a simple React app that interacts with the protocol.\nYou'll learn how to connect your wallet, create streams, and create pools using the Superfluid protocol.\n\n## How to Interact with the Superfluid Protocol\n\nWhen interacting with the Superfluid protocol from a client application, you'll use one of two contracts depending on the functionality you need:\n\n1. For Money Streaming: Use the [`CFAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) contract\n2. For Distribution Pools: Use the [`GDAv1Forwarder`](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder) contract\n\nWe use these forwarder contracts instead of building an SDK because:\n- It simplifies the integration process\n- It reduces the need for frequent updates to the SDK\n- It allows for more flexibility and direct interaction with the protocol\n\n## Contract Addresses and ABIs\n\nHere are the addresses for each contract acros",
      "s all Superfluid-supported chains:\n\n- `CFAv1Forwarder`: `0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125`\n- `GDAv1Forwarder`: `0x6DA13Bde224A05a288748d857b9e7DDEffd1dE08`\n\nYou can find the full ABIs for these contracts in the following technical references:\n- [CFAv1Forwarder ABI](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder)\n- [GDAv1Forwarder ABI](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder)\n\n## Creating a React App (Next.js)\n\nTo create a new Next.js app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your terminal and run:\n   ```\n   npx create-next-app@latest my-superfluid-app\n   ```\n2. Navigate to your new app directory:\n   ```\n   cd my-superfluid-app\n   ```\n3. Install necessary dependencies:\n   ```\n   npm install ethers@5.7.2\n   ```\n\n## Superfluid Interaction Component\n\nIn this section, we will provide a React component that allows you to interact with the Superfluid protocol.\nThis component will allow you to:\n- Connect your wallet (eg. Metamask)\n- Create a stream through the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract (for [Mone",
      "y Streaming](docs/concepts/overview/money-streaming))\n- Create a pool through the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract (for [Distribution Pools](docs/concepts/overview/distributions))\n\nHere's a React component that allows you to create a stream and create a pool. You can copy and paste this into a new file in your Next.js app's `pages` directory (e.g., `pages/superfluid-demo.js`):\n\n:::note\nFor a full list of available functions and events, refer to the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) and [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::\n\n```jsx live\n// Don't forget imports\n//import React, { useState } from 'react';\n//import { ethers } from 'ethers';\n\nfunction SuperfluidDemo() {\n  const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);\n  const [account, setAccount] = useState('');\n  const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState('');\n  const [receiverAddress, setReceiverAddress] = useState('');\n  const [flowRate, setFlowRat",

Copy the above code into a new file ",
      "in your Next.js app's `pages` directory (e.g., `pages/superfluid-demo.js`).\n2. Uncomment the necessary imports at the top of the file.\n3. Run your Next.js app with `npm run dev`.\n4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/superfluid-demo` in your browser.\n5. Connect your wallet, then you can create streams and pools using the Superfluid protocol.\n\nThis component provides a basic interface for creating streams and pools. In a production environment, you would want to add more error checking, input validation, and additional features.\n\n:::tip About the Component\nA few tips in order to make sure you can use the component correctly:\n- The component above uses simple ethers.js functions to interact with the Superfluid protocol. You can choose to use a different library or SDK if you prefer (eg. [Viem](https://viem.sh/), [Web3.js](https://docs.web3js.org/)).\n- The component does not manage wallet connections or chain switching in a production-ready way. You should add more robust error handling a",
      "nd user feedback.\n- The component uses the Superfluid forwarders ABIs in a simplified form. You can find the full ABIs in the [CFAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder) and [GDAv1Forwarder technical reference](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder).\n:::",

      " 40;\n```\n\nThis constant defines the minimum time interval (in milliseconds) between animation updates. It's used to throttle the animation and ensure that updates occur no more frequently than every 40 milliseconds.\n\n## Utility Functions\n\n### `absoluteValue`\n\n```jsx\nexport const absoluteValue = (n: bigint) => {\n  return n >= BigInt(0) ? n : -n;\n};\n```\n\nConverts a `bigint` to its absolute value. This function is crucial for calculations that require the non-negative form of a number.\n\n### `toFixedUsingString`\n\n```jsx\nexport function toFixedUsingString(numStr: string, decimalPlaces: number): string {\n  // Implementation details\n}\n```\n\nFormats a number (expressed as a string) to a specified number of decimal places. This function is essential for displaying the balance in a user-friendly format, ensuring that the balance is rounded and displayed with a consistent number of decimal places.\n\n## Hooks\n\n### `useSignificantFlowingDecimal`\n\n```jsx\nexport const useSignificantFlowingDecimal = (fl",
      "owRate: bigint, animationStepTimeInMs: number): number | undefined => {\n  // Hook logic\n};\n```\n\nDetermines the number of significant decimal places to display based on the flow rate and animation step time. This custom hook helps adjust the precision of the balance display dynamically, based on how quickly the balance is changing.\n\n### `useFlowingBalance`\n\n```jsx\nconst useFlowingBalance = (startingBalance: bigint, startingBalanceDate: Date, flowRate: bigint) => {\n  // Hook logic\n};\n```\n\nCalculates and updates the flowing balance over time. This hook is the core of the component, using the `requestAnimationFrame` API to smoothly update the balance display at a rate that's throttled by `ANIMATION_MINIMUM_STEP_TIME`.\n\n## FlowingBalance Component\n\n```jsx\nconst FlowingBalance: React.FC<{startingBalance: bigint; startingBalanceDate: Date; flowRate: bigint;}> = memo(({ startingBalance, startingBalanceDate, flowRate }) => {\n  // Component logic\n});\n```\n\nThis functional component uses the above",
      ' hooks and utility functions to render the flowing balance. It takes `startingBalance`, `startingBalanceDate`, and `flowRate` as props, calculating the current balance based on these inputs and displaying it in a formatted manner.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nBelow is an example of how to use the `FlowingBalance` component within your application.\n\n```jsx\n<FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n```\n\nThis component exemplifies how to combine React\'s capabilities with the performance of the Web APIs to create dynamic and responsive UIs. By breaking down the component into its constituent parts, developers can gain insights into its functionality and customize it according to their needs.\n\n:::tip My component is being jumpy, what can I do?\nSometimes, especially if you center your component using `justifyContent: "center"`, the component may have a jumpy behaviour like below:\n',
      '<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n    ❌ <FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n</div>\nIf you run into this issue, you can try to set a fixed width to the component like such:\n```jsx\n<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <div style={{ width: "135px", margin: "auto" }}>\n    <FlowingBalance startingBalance={BigInt("1000000000000000000")} startingBalanceDate={new Date(\'2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\')} flowRate={BigInt("1000000000000000")} />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\nThis should fix the jumpy behaviour and make the component flow smoothly like the example below:\n<div style={{ display: "flex", fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "bold", justifyContent: "center" }}>\n  <div style={{ width: "160px", margin: "auto" }}>\n   ✅ <FlowingBalance startingBalance={Bi',

This helps prevent excessive CPU usage and ensures a smooth user experience.\n- **Use fixed width**: If the component is jumpy, consider setting a fixed width to the component to ensure a smooth flow of the balance.\n- **Time conversion**: When showing the flow rate and converting the blockchain value to a human-readable value (eg. wei/s to ETH/month),\n    ensure that the time conversion is accurate and consistent with the rest of Superfluid's time-based calculations:\n    - 1 year = 365 days\n    - 1 month = 1 year/12\n    - 1 day = 24 hours\n    - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n    - 1 minute = 60 seconds\n    - 1 second = 1000 milliseconds\n- **Current timestamp**: Following Superfluid's implementation, it is r",
      "ecommended to use `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp in milliseconds instead of using `(await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest')).timestamp` for example.\n",

You can view balances in Metamask, transfer funds using Gnosis Safe, and even swap Super Tokens on platforms like Uniswap.\n- **Forward Compatibility**: While tools like Metamask and Gnosis Safe can display balances accurately, they do not support all functionalities of Super Tokens. For example, you cannot swap your streamed money on Automated Market Makers (eg. Uniswap).\n\n## Balance Tracking Considerations\n",
      "\nTracking the balance of Super Tokens requires a more nuanced approach than traditional ERC20 tokens.\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Event-Based Tracking Limitation**: Some applications, like Etherscan, use `transfer` events to track user balances. However, due to scalability concerns, Super Tokens don't emit `transfer` events with every balance change, leading to potential discrepancies in displayed balances.\n- **Multi-source updates**: Super Tokens can be updated from multiple sources, from [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx), but also [Distributions](/docs/protocol/distributions/overview.mdx).\n\n### Solution 1 (recommended): Using `balanceOf`\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Super Tokens are ERC20 compatible, so you can use the `balanceOf` function from the token smart contract to get the real time aggregated balance of a user.\nThe Superfluid Protocol modifies the `balanceOf` function to account for the various fund movement methods unique to Super Tokens including Money St",
      'reaming and Distributions.\nYou can simply call this function to get the real time aggregated balance of a user like so:\n\n```jsx\nconst fetchBlockchainBalance = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    setError("");\n    try {\n      const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n        "YOUR PROVIDER URL"\n      );\n      const contractAddress = "0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f"; //fake DAIx contract address on Mumbai\n      const contractABI = [\n        "function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint value)",\n        "function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint balance)",\n      ];\n      const contract = new ethers.Contract(\n        contractAddress,\n        contractABI,\n        provider\n      );\n      const userAddress = liveAddress;\n      const balance = await contract.balanceOf(userAddress);\n      return(ethers.utils.formatEther(balance.toString()));\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error("Error fetching blockchain balance:", error);\n    }\n  };\n```\n\n:::',
      "tip About Accuracy\nWe recommend this solution because it guarantees the most accurate result. However, it is important to note that this method is not always possible depending on your application architecture design.\n:::\n\n### Solution 2: Using queries from the Subgraph\n\nTo accurately track Super Token balances, you can use the queries below to get inflows and outflow object from Superfluid's [Subgraph](https://explorer.superfluid.finance/subgraph).\n\n#### Getting all the inflows for user\n```graphql\nquery allReceivedStreams($receiver: String) {\n  cfaStreams: streams(where: {receiver: $receiver}) {\n    currentFlowRate\n    streamedUntilUpdatedAt\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n  }\n  gdaStreams: poolMembers(where: {account: $receiver}) {\n    pool {\n      totalUnits\n      flowRate\n      totalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n      updatedAtTimestamp\n    }\n    units\n    totalAmountReceivedUntilUpdatedAt\n    poolTotalAmountDistributedUntilUpdatedAt\n    updatedAtTimestamp\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Getting all the o",

      "ayable`: Upgrades native tokens to Super Tokens.\n2. `upgradeByETHTo(address to) payable`: Upgrades native tokens to Super Tokens and transfers them to a specified address.\n\n### Unwrapping (Downgrading) Functions\n\nFor unwrapping Super Tokens back to ERC20 tokens, you can use the following functions from the [Super Token interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken):\n1. `downgrade(uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens back to ERC20 tokens.\n2. `downgradeTo(address to, uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens to ERC20 tokens and transfers them to a specified address.\n\nFor unwrapping Native Super Tokens (like ETHx), you can use the following function from the [ISETH interface](/docs/technical-reference/ISETH):\n1. `downgradeToETH(uint256 amount)`: Downgrades Super Tokens back to native tokens.\n\n:::warning Approval for Wrapping\nBefore wrapping ERC20 tokens into Super Tokens, you need to approve the Super Token contract to spend your ERC20 tokens. This is not needed for unwrapping.\n::",
      ":\n\n## Live Code Example: Wrapping ERC20 to Super Token\n\nHere's a simple example of how to wrap an ERC20 token into a Super Token using ethers.js:\n\n```jsx live\nfunction WrapERC20ToSuperToken() {\n  const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState('');\n\n  const wrapTokens = async () => {\n    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {\n      try {\n        await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });\n        const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\n        const signer = provider.getSigner();\n\n        // ERC20 token contract - you need to replace this with the actual token address\n        const erc20Address = '0x123...'; // Replace with actual ERC20 token address\n        const erc20Abi = ['function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)'];\n        const erc20Contract = new ethers.Contract(erc20Address, erc20Abi, signer);\n\n        // Super Token contract - you need to replace this with ",
      "the actual Super Token address\n        const superTokenAddress = '0x456...'; // Replace with actual Super Token address\n        const superTokenAbi = ['function upgrade(uint256 amount) external'];\n        const superTokenContract = new ethers.Contract(superTokenAddress, superTokenAbi, signer);\n\n        // Approve the Super Token contract to spend ERC20 tokens\n        const approveTx = await erc20Contract.approve(superTokenAddress, amount);\n        await approveTx.wait();\n        setStatus('Approval successful. Wrapping tokens...');\n\n        // Upgrade (wrap) ERC20 to Super Token\n        const upgradeTx = await superTokenContract.upgrade(amount);\n        await upgradeTx.wait();\n        setStatus('Tokens successfully wrapped!');\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error:', error);\n        setStatus('Error: ' + error.message);\n      }\n    } else {\n      setStatus('Please install MetaMask!');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={amount",
      '}\n        onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder="Amount to wrap"\n      />\n      <button onClick={wrapTokens}>Wrap Tokens</button>\n      <p>{status}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n:::warning Replace Placeholder Addresses\nReplace the placeholder addresses in the code above with actual contract addresses of your ERC20 token and Super Token.\n:::\n\nThis example demonstrates how to:\n1. Connect to the user\'s wallet\n2. Approve the Super Token contract to spend ERC20 tokens\n3. Upgrade (wrap) ERC20 tokens to Super Tokens\n\nFor more detailed information about the ISuperToken interface and its functions, please refer to our [ISuperToken Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/ISuperToken).',

Anyone can create Superfluid vesting schedules easily by using the no-code\nSuperfluid Dashboard or the Vesting Scheduler SDK built on a robust smart contract framework\n\n\n## Vesting with the Superfluid Dashboard (No-code)\n\n### Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard\n\nNavigate to the [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/vesting). Ensure you are connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Polygon Mumbai for testing or Ethereum mainnet for live transactions).\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/dashboard-vesting.png\" alt=\"Vesting Dashboard\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n:::note\nVesting via the dashboard requires a simple whitelisting. Register your interest to be whitelisted [here](https://airtable.com/appmq3TJDdQUrTQpx/shr6iaRWUXVZwVWSd).\n\n::",
      ":\n\n### Step 2: Creating the Vesting Schedule\nFill in the information below in order to create a vesting schedule:\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-schedule.gif\" alt=\"Create Vesting Schedule\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n1. **Receiver**: Enter the public address, ENS, or Lens of the recipient.\n2. **Super Token**: Select the Super Token you wish to vest. If you don't have super tokens, you can wrap your tokens using the [Super Token Wrapper](https://app.superfluid.finance/wrap).\n3. **Vesting Start Date**: Set the date and time when the vesting will start.\n4. **Total Vested Amount**: Input the total amount of tokens to be vested.\n5. **Total Vesting Period**: Specify the duration over which the tokens will vest.\n6. **Optional Cliff**: Toggle the 'Add Cliff' option and specify the cliff amount and period if needed.\n\n:::note\nThe \"cliff amount\" is the amount of tokens that will be vested at the start ",
      "of the vesting period. For example, if you set a cliff of 100 tokens, the recipient will receive 100 tokens at the start of the vesting period, and the remaining tokens will be vested over the vesting period.\n:::\n\n### Step 3: Preview and Create\n\nAfter entering the vesting parameters, preview the vesting schedule to ensure everything is correct. Then, create the vesting schedule with a single transaction.\n\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-preview.png\" alt=\"Vesting Preview\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n### Step 4: Sharing the Vesting Schedule\n\nA link to the vesting schedule status page can be shared with the recipient, providing them with an up-to-date view of their vesting progress.\n<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n  <img src=\"/assets/vesting-ongoing.png\" alt=\"Vesting Custom Page\" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n## Vesting using the S",
      "uperfluid Vesting Scheduler (for Devs)\n\nThe Vesting Scheduler is a sophisticated smart contract designed for setting up token vesting schedules.\nIt's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient.\nThe contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream,\nensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the Vesting Scheduler, check out the Vesting Scheduler Automation [Full Guide](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/automations/vesting-scheduler).\n\nIf you have questions about how to build with this smart contract framework, don't hesitate to reach out to our team or community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pPzPEDMVua)!\n\n\n---\n\n## Benefits of Superfluid Vesting\n\nSuperfluid vesting offers:\n\n* **Simple UI**: A user-friendly interface allowing easy setup in just a few clicks.\n* **Full Liqui",
      "dity**: Maintained liquidity for senders and immediate token flow for receivers.\n* **Composability**: The ability to transfer vested tokens seamlessly to DeFi products.\n* **Reduced Volatility**: Tokens are streamed every second, mitigating market volatility.\n* **Enhanced Security**: Safe streaming without locking tokens in a contract.\n* **No Custody**: Tokens are streamed directly to the recipient's wallet.\n\nFor a hands-on demonstration, try setting up a vesting schedule on the Superfluid Dashboard or explore building with the smart contract framework today.",
